andamanneg = The Azad Hind has accepted our diplomatic invitation for negotiations to resolve the Andaman territorial dispute.,Ne Win was informed about this and met with his cabinet to plan what to say or do for Burma to profit from the negotiation,Ne Win Plans to do everything possible so that, regardless of the annexation of the archipelago, Burma remains sovereign and demonstrates that it does not accept any gesture of submission from Azad Hind,Among the doubts surrounding the cabinet, Ne Win feared that the negotiations would be a failure and that this would lead to a war against India or an intensification of the dispute that could generate a weakness in the government,Despite all this, Ne Win simply wanted India to see Burma as a partner despite the dispute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

burma2 = even though the anti-Japanese guerrillas have been extinguished,the militias that sail from within the cities and the population still present a delay to the plans of Ne Win,with this, attacks and sabotage are still carried out in the most metropolitan cities including Yangon, a tourist palace that contained one of the biggest attractions that could attract tourists and journalists to sustain the Burmese economy was destroyed with a terrorist attack with use of bombs,causing 10 injuries and 2 taken to hospital,the current one did not have the objective of killing anyone in particular but rather to lower the morale of the ne Win government who saw this gesture as an invitation for the beginning of a domino effect of attacks and retaliations until it escalates into a civil war,Ne Win only ordered the reconstruction of the statue and the investigation to find out who was responsible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
burma3 = The first steps towards the triumph of the Ne Win era is the establishment of a large railway network for the transportation and loading of supplies, whether civil or military, in less favored regions that connects the city of Hakha,crosses sagain and mandalay until end in Taunggyi,Burma is a nation that has vast plains in the center but with mountains and rocks on its edges, which makes cities and towns in these regions less favored and more difficult to access,beyond the military issue in case of an invasion or civil war where railways will be of great help in transporting military supplies to more mountainous regions,the chief engineers appointed by Ne Win knew that When the railway is completed,he will be an easy target for the militias and rebels but Ne Win assured that with its inauguration, he would keep the railway guarded and do everything to prevent an attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
andaman = Returning to diplomatic matters, the most important crisis that Burma has is the dispute over the Andaman archipelago in the south of our sea, the archipelago became the target of a territorial dispute with the Azad Hind,although this does not involve ethnicity or anything historical, Burma claims the archipelago and this started in the war of unification of India, where Azad Hind requested military and logistical support from Burma to unify India and with that, several Burmese military bases were built in the archipelago and with that there was a growth in the Burmese population in the region and with this population, the Azad Hind began a government of persecution with an ethnocentric government against the Burmese in the region and with this persecution, Burma claims sovereignty in the archipelago alleging a violation of the offer of aid to the Azad Hind with Burma seeing this persecution as an attack on Burma and negatively impacting diplomatic support with Azad Hind since the Indian unification war and with the beginning of Ne Win's plans, the diplomatic crisis is expected to be resolved directly, either through negotiations or military action,Ne Win was aware that if Burma went to war with Azad Hind, they had practically no chance because the Burmese army was much less advanced and small compared to Azad Hind,then, Ne Win may plan a negotiation as a first plan either to annex the archipelago or to demand greater sovereignty for the Burmese people in the region even with Indian control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

behr1 = Behr1 was a commander who gained notoriety in the South African war and ended up joining the government council given his leadership prominence,in the midst of the crisis after Huttig's death, a penny had dropped for the others,even if the plan to Keep the Reichstatt Alive worked, keeping the Reichstatt standing longer did not guarantee that it would last forever,Even with the entire central Africa under the control of raw material extraction, the Reichstatt is finding itself even more in need of a way to raise funds, spending on ethnocentric reforms and the containment of rebel movements is increasingly expensive and the local currency becoming increasingly inflamed with rampant printing, with that, the rest of the council already knew that if they continued like this they would break the Reichstatt once and for all but they never spoke or warned Huttig due to their extremely Isolated Vision and a habit of Paranoia of supposed rebels,but now with his death, Behr was chosen to be Huttig's successor since his reform idea caught everyone's attention at the meeting, called "the Behr plan" consists of a major appeasement reform similar to Speer's more liberal plans,Behr knew that the extreme practice of Ethnocentrism was costing him dearly, so he decided that it should change to something more gradual and temporal than immediate and radical.Instead of mass exclusions, this could be replaced by a system of segregation where white and black Aryans were separated. in even everyday things like bathrooms, seats, rooms, everything,This means that there is no interracial mixing of the two and as time goes on, the Aryan race will take over Africa continuously. while the lower races were subjected to an ever-increasing separation until they became merely laborOf course, this involves issues of having to accept living in the same space as an inferior race, however, Behr claims that he plans to make Intervention Ideas to make these races increasingly poorer and with less opportunity to the point that labor was the only option and they didn't have a fund for an earthquake or a child                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
behr2 = with the approval of the Behr plan, the idea was adjusted to extend and solve possible problems that may occur such as a probable greater population of inferior races since their exclusion and extinction over time were not guaranteed. and even subjugated by slave labor, this could cause a lack of labor if they really start to become extinct and there is no other inferior race to replace them.Behr predicts that by the time the inferior races are extinct, the Aryan race will be ready and developed to care for their own land as a pure and flawless race but there are risks of it not happening and Behr does not guarantee that,so Behr also added to his plan a colonial expansion to Madagascar and South Africa to transform them into open-air work camps,continuing the Madagascar plan of forced emigration of labor,Madagascar would become a colony of the Reichstatt made especially for it becomes a camp where only the forced labor of the inferior races would predominate to extract raw materials from the site,In addition to extermination plans for extreme cases since the region is home to several diseases that can be studied and used as a biological weapon in case of revolt or ethnic cleansing while South Africa would be integrated into the Reichstatt and the Behr segregation policy would be judged, since thanks to the increase in the Boere population, this would not be difficult                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

reichstatt6 = Despite the greater duration of the Great Reichstatt Empire thanks to the reform plans,This did not guarantee that it would last forever, as the total isolation of the Reichsstatt from the world meant that planned prosperity would be slow even with the mass extraction of wealth from Central Africa,Furthermore, the local Germanic currency is increasingly weak and worthless with ethnocentric reforms being even more expensive than others.and the accelerated printing of currency made it unsustainable to keep the Reichstatt's economic structure standing,however, Behr, one of the main members of the council in angoche They have a plan that they had hidden from Huttig until his death, but they have the trust of the others to expose it and approve it,Behr gained notoriety thanks to his experience as a commander but is still seen as a rookie and among all the others, seen as the easiest to change sides and betray the Reichstatt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
steinort1 = Steinort was sent from the Reichstatt on a secret mission of German interest,Even though the Volkstaat and the Reichstatt were allies, Huttig always desired a massive expansion of his empire and saw South Africa as a prominent land,with the infiltration of Steinort, the plan to transform South Africa into a colony of the Reichstatt will be implemented However, there are two possibilities to achieve this,from the inside out or from the outside in,this means that Steinort can stage a coup d'état Abolish the constitution and declare the colony or calls upon the Reichstatt army for a massive invasion using the newly formed government as support along with the guard that ensured steinort  to forcibly occupy the whole of South Africa and have the entire country under military control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
wnrhodes = The Rhodes Archipelago was abandoned by the Burgundian colonial government, since the collapse of Burgundy would mean the destruction of the archives and documentation of ethnological studies in the region, making scientists and governors abandoned the place and only maintained a provisional government that would try to keep the archipelago standing in case of a return,however, with the departure, Turkey saw an opportunity to occupy the archipelago that was a region of dispute between Turks, Italians and Greeks,by occupying the archipelago with little resistance, the Hellenic state contested the occupation as an invasion of an ancient Greek archipelago and demanded the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region, something that Turkey refused, with this, the Hellenic state declared war on the Turks for the second time,thus beginning the Rhodes War                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

oceng = Claye's decision to nationalize northern industries generated a certain improvement in the economy, but this decision displeased the oligarchs who had influence in the industries and profited from the Burgundian work in the region,However, with the nationalization of these industries, the oligarchs lost much of their source of profit, which was left only with other industrial campaigns around Scotland but which was meant to displease them,with that, they sent a letter to Claye demanding a reform so that the profits of the industries would return to the oligarchs and demonstrated broad disapproval of Claye because of his more amateurish character in Administration, the oligarchs through the letter threatened to cut industries in Scotland and immigrate from the country which would also cause turbulence in Scotland and soon in England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

painter1 = Roy Painter was appointed head of state of England after the resignation of Claye,The emergency English parliament saw a good option to appoint them and thus try to resolve the oligarchs' crisis as much as possible,Painter is an apt corporatist who knows how to listen to the market and could be a good opportunity for the oligarchs to make a deal, despite his ideal solution, Painter is frowned upon by certain parts of parliament for being considered a puppet of the corporatists,obeying them like a pet,However, in the current situation, your dependence on corporations could be useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
eng1 = Since the creation of the nation we call home,the military and economic industry was totally dependent on the Burgundian regime,Because our doors to a relationship with the outside world have been closed thanks to the extremely isolationist policy to the point that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has become completely useless,our export and import trade only received cargoes coming from the Burgundian ports that created their product through the rich lands and mines in their colonies,Who were subjugated by a Spartan mentality of consuming the minimum,now, the English colonial government opened its new ports and import points in Hull,Hartlepool And Grimsby, for the collection of exports coming from Belgian and Dutch ports, which are currently Burgundian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
eng2 = The Spartan English economy, which was totally dependent on Burgundy, has just broken down completely,with the collapse of Burgundy after Himmler's death,England finds itself totally dependent on itself and other colonies in Wales and Scotland,with the collapse of the economy, widespread chaos took over the streets of London, with the SS military police being called in to contain the revoltsThanks to the extreme Burgundian purge policy, the chances of a civil war are minimal,but even so the government will have to react to recover the economy to keep it on its feet, one of the options could be the nationalization of the Burgundian industrial networks in the north of the country that were Burgundian owned  but now with its collapse, they could be nationalized in addition to the request for a commercial link with Wales to export its resources to England established an exchange network between both so that the effect of the economic crash is reduced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
waleso1 = England has sent us a request for a trade agreement to exchange industrial resources to keep the island of Britain afloat in the face of economic collapseAfter the collapse of Burgundy, the island of Brittany became completely isolated from any export network, being isolated with only its own nationalized economy,in addition to England, Scotland was also affectedThe Welsh mining and industrial exploration network is quite abundant with Burgundy's focus on turning Wales into an open-air concentration camp with documents dictating that Wales has more exploration camps than houses,Being abundant with resources for itself,This motivated England to make a swap deal that could benefit both sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

cndnz1 = with such division and war against Nazism, even though its creator nations were extinguished, the Nazi ideal still spread throughout the world like a virus,With Idolatries coming from different ideals arriving from Africa to Asia,the invisible wall made by the Goldwater doctrine was not enough for the parasite of fascism to penetrate the Americas,in Canada, the fascist ideal Corrupted and distorted the idea of Quebec, the French separatist movement of Quebec It has also spread with its more extreme variations, with groups and parties that want Quebec's independence for a value of racial and ancestral superiority,not being a headache for the Canadian government, but the distortion of ideas that a country can do to the world is still noticeable,and one of the fascist ideals that has corrupted the Canadian mentality is the Brotherhood of Aryans of the new world or just B.A.N.W, a Canadian Nazi movement that has gained strength in recent years as a revolutionary group who wants to extinguish the Jews and the American tribes and Indians who are in Canada,with the already tarnished and not at all secret image of the Nazism of the German Reich and Burgundy,the movement did not speak out and was strongly repressed by the media, population and government, being a type of group where its members hide their participation in public,but who act secretly in meetings and protests,What could have been just a movement of poor people became something problematic given Canada's inefficiency in maintaining its composure as a permanent seat member of the OFN,over the years,Canada has become increasingly dependent on the United States,both for its protection and economy and diplomacy,in addition to the distorted ideal of nationalism being seen as probable fascism and being persecuted even if it is only from patriotic parties or groups and Canada's weakness in diplomacy to resolve its issues with Australia and Joh Bjelke-Petersen,With all this together, B.A.N.W began to gain strength from rebels and those dissatisfied with the British Canadian royalty, with the protests increasing in number and the so-called public shame of showing oneself as a member of B.A.N.W no longer existing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

reichstatt2 = A meeting was organized with the main commanders of the Reichstatt, but without Huttig's awareness,because these commanders met to discuss an idea or a plan for when Huttig dies,With the German civil war, local commanders learned about human selfishness and knew that if something was not done, Huttig's post would lead to civil war which would be a thousand times more chaotic than the European one,so, an agreement was made between them,As long as Huttig remains breathing, the Reichstatt's most trusted commanders will vie for influence and when Huttig dies,they will demand a Reichstatt vote in Angoche to decide among the district administrators to elect the successor,thus not having a discontent among them about someone small or insignificant for the position,but deep down, they all knew,that an aggressive reaction could occur when it happened,with everyone determined to be the next successor of huttig                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

colnz2 = the VDA marched together with its independent private army to the bottom of Colombia, reaching Córdoba,As Bogotá approaches, the VDA demands the demobilization of Colombian troops from the city of Bogotá and the departure of the military government to impose a new regime under the influence of the VDA and the SPA, despite being just a private army, the Colombian resistance is too weak to fight them completely, since the SPA has already shown its support for them and is in the event of an aggressive reaction, the SPA could respond at the same level, being disloyal to the Colombian army and being able to start a new conflict in a way that guarantees the total defeat of the new grenade,but if there is no immediate response and only government compliance with the VDA,they will clearly carry out a coup d'état and declare a new openly Nazi state, being able to enjoy it as a garden of a house and apply its ethnocentric laws and morals being mostly palingenetic and corporatist, being almost or not at all hesitant and purging the old leaders and the Colombian egg that will enter the government's target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

patagon1arg = with the rise of the military government, discontent has been growing in the Patagonia region among the Mapuche people,Clear persecution and censorship has been taking place against the Mapuche people with the beginning of the construction of concentration camps that aim to imprison enemies of the nation but which are being used to imprison political opponents and Mapuches, even though there is little or no evidence of their crimes,this ethno-religious resentment coming from the military comes mainly from distrust in Mapuche involvement in Peronism,since many Mapuche groups were Peronist thanks to Perón's populism,With the discontent, several movements of revolt and protest have been taking place, with the largest of them being a march demanding an end to the Mapuche persecution, orchestrated by the Social Mapuche party,However, the military government has not taken it seriously, as they recognize that the Mapuches did not have the capacity for popular revolt to the point of overthrowing the government,since there has always been an ethnic division between the Mapuches and the Argentines, with at most the civil police being called in to prevent any increase in the scale of the revolt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

petersen1 = Joh Bjelke-Petersen is a populist Australian politician who has charmed the ears of Australia with his understanding of the fight against the bourgeois elite and right-wing thinking being quite similar to the ideal of Pierre Poujade of France,Petersen dedicated the years that Snedden was in power to ensuring his positioning, especially taking into account the Cold War against Japan,However, his speech about the end of the elite also leads to agendas such as the total independence of Australia, which is still in the hands of the English monarchy in Canada, and the transformation of the country into a new Republic, something that could generate diplomatic problems against Canada and even the OFN if Petersen follows through on this,Despite his enthusiasm to achieve his goals, Petersen draws bad looks from the Australian parliament, as he has already been denounced as a tyrant who ruled Queensland for 20 years and now wants to rule Australia as his home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
petersen2 = Petersen as his first move as new Prime Minister forms a Liberal coalition with Wylie Gibbs,its formation as a way to strengthen its position and confront any opposition is also a step towards Australia's plan to free itself from the monarchy,since the agenda of freedom and the fight against the elite has increased and now, Petersen is sending indirect messages in his speech against the Canadian monarchy and the OFN, sounding the alert for diplomats who may witness a diplomatic crisis that could result in future problems either against the OFN or against Japan,However, Petersen has made it clear in his interviews that if he truly wants to transform Australia into a republic, he will ensure calculated steps are taken to not sever ties with the OFN and keep Australia safe from Japan or any external opponent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
petersen3 = Given Petersen's boldness in his endeavor to combat the elites,His moves to subtly criticize the Canadian monarchy and emphasize Australia's transformation into a republic caused Canada's government-in-exile to begin to view Petersen as a potential enemy, who could come up with plans to interfere in Australian politics to prevent any weakening of the monarchy or even a rise of republicanism in Canada,Responding to Petersen as a "Vulgar Provocateur" in the Newspapers,with this conflict on a large scale, Petersen has no doubt that Canada or the OFN will send any hired assassin to silence him or orchestrate his impeachment,Therefore, Petersen declares his fight against the elites with an iron fist and that he will even use aggressive means to get what he wants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
petersen4 = with the diplomatic conflict against Canada, there are two ways to achieve the objective directly,Petersen could join forces with his coalition and Wylie Gibbs to introduce republican reform into the Australian Congress and peacefully transform Australia into a republic.or use their influence and abolish Congress and the Constitution to centralize power and declare a new Republic, in an aggressive and risky manner for diplomacy with the OFN,If the reform passes through Congress, there is no certainty of approval given the influence and likely Canadian intervention in the vote,preventing Petersen and even being able to provide a loophole for his deposition,but if reform is done aggressively with abolition, Canada's view of Petersen will become certain that he is a tyrant and a chain reaction could result in Canada responding with sanctions, sending spies to eliminate Petersen or even demanding Australia's expulsion from the OFN,the risk is all yours player                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

thai_intro = Since the black coup in February, Thailand has found itself back in its status quo, returning to old patterns, with the coup, a coalition was made by reactionary politicians who for the most part They only thought about their own navel and decided to join the coalition for their own benefit,The Thai Military Party found itself as the only party in existence as democracy was abolished giving way to a reactionary military dictatorship who decided to witch hunt his opponents and completely reform Thailand into a nationalist and pro-Japan Thailand,has openly declared himself against Norio Ohga, the current Prime Minister of Japan, but he still remains in co-prosperity because it is a delicate and risky thing to leave  but will be willing to react if unwanted influence knocks on Thailand's doors,in the midst of this young government, a new policy of doctrine and cultural revolution occurs within Thai lands,with doctrines of total rejection of foreigners, whether in customs or politics, something that generates revolt among young people which is the biggest of targets,Everyone in the coalition knows that in the slightest case of destabilization, the entire newly constructed government will fall to the ground because the coalition is not in sync since the majority only wants their own benefits and does not think twice before leaving the ship almost sinking,therefore, the military created the "red gaurs",a special paramilitary group created to act in cases of lack of control or destruction within the government, being an important piece in the pillars of the new government, but which can also be the greatest enemy in case of disagreements.With all this, Thailand is going through another new era of changes that will define the history books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
thaiev1 = the current Head of State responsible for the February coup has just passed away due to heart problems,something that the coalition already expected as he had already demonstrated previous health problems,With his death, a riot could be widespread for the fight for the new post that will remain empty and commanded by the Thai military council,with the main members of the coalition being choonhavan, an old man in Thai politics who clearly entered the coalition to save his own skin from any punishment by the military and who enjoys his position's for his own benefit, being someone not so well regarded by the red gaurs for being considered a "deadbeat" who doesn't really fight for the cause since he was already someone active before the coup,ngarn is an openly fascist politician who joined the coalition to benefit from his nationalist ideology and save your skin from death, having tendencies almost equal to those of the military, ngarn is a competitor who will not be sure of the council's loyalty,but thanks to his Thai fascism, he had gone down the same curve and finally we have adireksarn, a revolutionary nationalist who, dissatisfied with democratic reforms, joined the coalition to fight for the cause of the status quo and the return of Thailand's recognition by the world, he demonstrates that if selected for succession, he will initially remain in his external presence, since he demonstrates contempt and resentment towards the Americans who increasingly expand their influence and interference in Thai culture,having no remorse in case of attack against American bases or open hate letter against Americans,despite being united, the military council knows that the total disconnection from the coalition could be problematic due to their intentions behind participation,be it a probable betrayal or a planned change of pace, with the council also being able to choose to remain in government until a majority agrees on the decision,with the council's plans being extremely closed and planning previous acts to avoid any unthought or out of control means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

liberalchina1 = In the face of liberal reforms and the rise of a promised era of democracy in Japan,Riberaru Sensen representatives arrived in Nanjing to impose liberal reforms on China, as well as Indochina,knowing the broad disagreement with the gongbo reactionaries and the old guard nationalists,a conference was opened for a broad vote by the Chinese parliament to approve the reforms,with previously invisible liberal politicians now gaining prominence as the main action taker of the country's liberalization,the conference was quite turbulent, with the popular presence being huge in Shanghai, the city where the conference will take place,although the majority of the population agreed with the reform because they believed that China's future would be better,the presence of old-guard reactionaries is still significant, most of whom are politicians who want the gongbo dynasty to continue for personal purposes as oligarchs,from within the conference, a majority may be in favor of the cause, since not only the liberals are together but also former governors such as Lu Han who will bring their influence as governor from Yunnan to a long-awaited dream and with all the evidence in mind about the fate of the conference, a security guard was created in case there was a violent reaction from the population, whether or not the reform was approved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
liberalfail = The end of the conference was the trigger for one of the most aggressive reactions from the old guard, with the vote being the approval of the reform, the old guard did not accept the result and fears being purged from China Soon, with that, he summoned the militias in his favor and attacked the cities around Shanghai to try to surround Shanghai and occupy the building,however, the Japanese representatives and the liberals already anticipated a strong reaction from the old guard and before the conference began,they founded a new special guard made to repel aggressive reactions,with the attacks, the new guard received immediate orders to execute the Tiewan plan,where the new guard would occupy the government headquarters of the Chinese capital and apply liberal reform together with military martial law to have free will and repel the old guard,Even with the aggressive reaction of the old guard, the reform was still applied, but in a more aggressive way, thus beginning an era of liberal-stratocratic China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
liberalsuc = The end of the conference was a cause for celebration throughout China, as the results demonstrated the approval of the reform in a decisive way thanks to the union of the liberals and the union of the Chinese governors,thus beginning a new era of democracy in China,and despite the celebration, the old guard that always defended an ancient China in the style of zongwu showed disapproval, but until then, nothing could be done against a conformist majority,Japanese representatives gave an ultimatum to the old guard, leave the country or extinguish the old guard to join the liberal government, with most of the old guard preferring to leave the country and immigrate to the United States, with their supervision being guaranteed after negotiations with the American Ministry of Foreign Affairs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
bolwar = With the political weakness within Santistevan, the Bolivian government saw a great opportunity to invade the place and reconquer the Chaco by right, after the war against Paraguay and the fall of the government.,zambelli implemented rigorous reforms from within the government to repel any rebellion, with this, the persecution reached even his cabinet, with members of the government being arrested and even killed for alleged treason and rebellion scheme in favor of Santa Cruz which caused some members of the government and oligarchs to join together and flee the country to Santa Cruz, which was demilitarized by order of the peace treaty. and together with a private paid militia, occupied the region and declared independence from Bolivia,Since then, a military dispute has occurred with Bolivia contesting the existence of Santistevan, and now with its weakness, the great opportunity to end the rebels has arrived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

scev2 = The coalition formed by the oligarchs to escape persecution in Bolivia after the war against Paraguay has shown itself to be a group that is only interested in enjoying its power and sucking the workers' money,using its Chaco territory as a real farm for its own interests,with this,It will only be a matter of time until the population of the region realizes and takes action,and among the movements that oppose the rule of the oligarchs and even want the region to be integrated back into Bolivia,there is the Falangist movement of Santa Cruz, led by Carlos Valverde Barbery, an ethnic-centric nationalist that moves the streets of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in order to further its own interests for its doctrine of the Latin phalanx based on the old policies of Santa Cruz from 1960, the Falangists of Santa Cruz have shown themselves to be quite dangerous since the government of Santa Cruz is formed by oligarchs who founded the nation in a hurry and have almost no structure,making coups d'état easy, both by barbery and the military,and with the change of leaders, the dispute for position can weaken the government and give rise to a sudden fall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

menamex1 = Contrary to certain expectations with the succession of Aviles,Mena was chosen as the next successor of the party and the country,being something quite controversial within the party with even suspicions of plots since Mena is known for not wanting the spotlight and is always secluded in his office,but little did they know, that Mena used this moral rule of leaving him alone in his office to study and explore the world and the current Mexican geopolitical system in more depth.,becoming increasingly convinced that Mexico was living in an era of oligarchs and dictatorial dynasties and that if nothing was done it could cause future problems,despite being part of the party, Mena never showed extremism and was always a peaceful person who did not have great ambitions, but with his discoveries about the silencing, the dynasty systems and corruption within the party, he decides to throw himself into a great and risky ambition, to redemocratize the country and reduce the party's power and with his hiring as party president, he will have to reformulate from the inside out and be careful with anyone's interventions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
menamex2 = With the reformulations, Mena consolidated his alliance with the most neutral politicians of the party to join his cabinet and defend himself from intervention,with this, using his despotism and maximum power, Mena abolishes the constitution that gave power to the PRI and creates a new one, opening Mexico's political agenda and leaving the elections and the geopolitical situation cleaner,but to maintain balance and prevent any extremist presence in geopolitics, Mena also created in the midst of the constitution,"party right", a diploma that is given to a political party that has passed the tests carried out for its creation and performance to be considered plausible to compete, with parties like liberals and social democrats being allowed and helping to dam extreme parties or movements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

okinoriev2 = Faced with Okinori's rise to power, his authoritarian and oligarchic ambitions caused some more liberal politicians to revolt against the machine of cycles of authority over Japan, with it,liberal politician Miki Takeo, along with other liberals and military men, founded the "riberaru Sensen",a liberal and military organization that focused on assisting Takeo and other politicians in their moves to restore democracy in the country,What could have been just another mediocre faction has become a threat and a focus for oligarchs and bureaucrats,pois the organization's objective was to come to power and redemocratize the nation,improve relations with the West, get rid of slave colonies and purge authoritarians, transforming Japan into a liberal "pro-Western" nation,with their help, any espionage or sabotage agency would be weakened with the assistance of the organization on any attack,Using an iron fist, the organization protects its founders and members from any attack and strengthens its political influence, thus creating a cold war scenario within Japan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
okinoriev3 = With the organization's influence, its strengthening plans expand to Osaka, and with that, a large popular election is held for the membership of unions and youth wings of workers to join forces and overthrow okinori,However, the influence of bureaucrats and authoritarians in the region makes noise in the face of elections, with the risk of fraud or even state intervention,but which can be confronted with the organization,If the votes are favorable to the unions joining the organization, its wing will expand to left-wing areas and this can make the organization strong,but, if the votes decide not to enter, the organization will limit itself to its endless war against Okinori,it is not certain that their war culminated in victory,but their eternity of fighting and conflict in the face of elections or influence could be laborious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

italyev4 = In view of the political conflicts involving Libya, a large business meeting was held in Tripoli,bringing together the government of Italy, the colonial government of Libya, the NALF and the Libyan Democratic Party, to discuss the future of the country after its independence,several proposals were made by diplomats sent from Rome,whose majority offered the territory to the Libyan Democratic Party and the NALF being practically the army of the new country,However, NALF is an extreme and reactionary organization and made it clear that they did not want any Italian fingers in the country which complicated the negotiations,Both Romas diplomats and the LDP cabinet knowing and wanting that Libya would become a dictatorship in the hands of Gaddafi and they wanted to at least be involved in the Libyan police to prevent any genocide or censorship in the country with at least the Italian army being able to act within the country with military bases or a democratic government of the LDP which has commercial and police partnerships with Italy,With all these disagreements and confusion, the conference will appear to take longer than expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
italyev5 = In view of the conference days in Tripoli,Giuseppe de Falco, newly elected president of Italy, takes control of the region's diplomacy despite orders to send diplomats to the conference,Compared to the other candidates, Falco appears to be more intolerant of the NALF, which for him is a terrorist and extremist organization that threatens Italian hegemony, however, he could not deny that Libya would one day be independent, however, he wanted its independence to benefit Italy and not destroy its hegemony,with that, Falco proposed an idea,Libya would be part of the NALF, however, the entire northern and coastal region of the country would belong to Italy with a new temporary colonial military regime,where according to him, the temporary control of the north would be used to keep the country balanced and at least there would be time for the Libyan population to get used to the new regime,Furthermore, in the meantime Italian control of northern Libya would be used to stifle any ethnic and religious disagreements so that there would be no conflicts within the country over NALF dominance,With this proposal, Falco clarified that this would be the only proposal he would bring and anything beyond that, Italy would not accept,with the NALF not liking the proposal and interpreting it as a plan of Italian infiltration in the region in the meantime, Italy implemented its European influence in the region, creating a clear division in the country and contradicting the ideals of the NALF who wants Libya to be entirely theirs and for there to be no European influence,with Gaddafi giving his last words.

(North African Liberation Front),commanded by a Libyan general simply called Gaddafi,the group emerged in the midst of the oil crisis, a result of the various and thousands of separatist movements that occurred in Sudan, Egypt, East Africa and others,the idea of independence arose before the North African who remained,However, as time passes, the costs of maintaining the colonies become more expensive, causing problems for the Italian economy., both the government and Andreotti know that sooner or later, they will have to abandon the region and leave it in the hands of the new independent government,but that they must keep the region safe and without any war or disagreement between them or Italy because the NALF is a very aggressive organization that aims for the North African revolution,and Italy has no doubt that they will kill their own people to get what they want                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
italyev3 = More attacks and sabotage take place in the city of Tripoli, Libya, where the NALF once again plans its attacks to weaken the government and demonstrate its sovereignty in the region,NALF also knows that one day it will get what it wants,however, that Italian insistence and the nation's influence are increasingly infiltrating the population,displeases the NALF which sees itself as a revolutionary Anti-Colonialist organization,Andreotti, together with his cabinet, will have to decide what to do to at least mitigate the attacks and calm the NALF's spirits.,because next year, the Italian elections will take place and depending on the result, Libya could be freed sooner or later,One of the main ways this can be done is to send a diplomat to negotiate an end to the attacks and depending on the negotiation, make the NALF at least wait for the end of the elections and decide for itself or for others about its desire with the new president, even if the NALF at least requires a piece of territory for its influence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
spainev1 = the Iberian ideal was broken,what would be an entire united peninsula has now become absolute chaos,the year is 1975,Portugal has already managed to reunify with the rise of Kaulza de Arriaga,however, Spain is still in turmoil with a frozen civil war and a broken government that could easily fall,the Iberian federal government still maintains several central regions and the military state of Murcia, however, it is still in conflict with the blue front and Árias Navarro to the north,Franco, the great Falangist leader, is cautious about the war, with his pragmatism, being able to sacrifice everything or nothing to reunite Iberia again,He longs for the end of the war, but still thanks God that at least Iberia is silent for now,the future is very uncertain, perhaps Franco may not even be able to complete his objective, either with his defeat in the war or his death,but he is determined to do everything he can to unite Iberia along the lines of good old Falangism, even if that means breaking some morals or rules of Falangism,Thanks to its atypical pragmatic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
spainev2 = Among the Sundays of the Iberian federal government of Franco, there is the military state of Murcia, a militarized region under Franco's rule.which aims to keep Murcia stable amidst Iberian rule,Spain, despite speaking Spanish, still has many linguistic and cultural differences, this resulted in the independence of Catalonia, the Basque countries and Galicia,However, in Murcia, when Franco's government set foot on their lands and raised the flag in the capital, the people rebelled,They didn't want Franks in their lands, to be excluded and considered sub-human because of their language, with the population and their Murcia militias assisting opponents of the Franco government in its expulsion,Franco knew that if he lost that region again, he would never take it back thanks to the support of the Blue Front.,then, Franco decided to create an autonomous military state in favor of negotiations with the population of the region,Murcia would not be subjugated amidst the rules of linguistic segregation of Falangism and they could freely live their lives in an autonomous state, in return, the region would still be controlled by Frankish influence and governance,which in turn, militarized the region to expel the blue front army from there, with Murcia being virtually the only puppet state in the remaining Iberian Peninsula.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n.
arabev1 = the goals of unifying Arabia into one nation were only realized as a dream, however,With each passing time, the great nation became increasingly separated from within, mainly by the Shiites and Sunnis,the Shiite Arab population has become increasingly excluded, causing them to migrate to poorer and more agricultural regions in search of easy employment opportunities,causing the majority of them to not even have the minimum to have decent jobs in the metropolises,being excluded and even suffering prejudice from Sunnis and other groups,Most of them did not have good conditions because they were immigrants from Iran who came to Saudi Arabia to escape the civil war that happened in the 60s,and not only were the Shiites having problems with differences, but also other groups, such as the Yemenites, Omanis, the Gulf Arabs and the people of Hejaz,Although the dream of unifying the peninsula is utopian, its cultures, customs and ideals are very different,These problems are ignored by the government, which shows its favoritism towards Yemen, as the president and his cabinet are only composed of Yemenis,generating exclusion of other peoples from the government,These mixed problems generated protests in several cities by Shiites and trade unionists demanding more rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

arabcoll = Amri was convinced that his federation would collapse,All forms of containment of the occupation in Mecca were a failure, generating disagreement in the army with them turning against Amri the situation was so chaotic that the only thing that could be possible was to think about his escape and avoid certain death, with Amri abolishing the parliament and declaring martial law, that wouldn't solve it, but it could buy him time before the rebels invade Riyadh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n. 
rua1 = Fernando De La Rua assumed the presidency of Argentina replacing Balbin,with that, the legacy of his government still continues with the objective of pacifying the political order years after the electoral crises between Peronists and non-Peronists,However, Balbin's government was marked by a certain incompetence since he caused inflation to rise with government spending in light of his reforms,However, almost never paying attention to reports of Peronism reaching churches and the subjugation of some provinces that elected Peronist mayors,almost certainly its remnants want to rekindle the government of Domingo Peron,something that displeased the military who saw Peronism as an anti-Democrat dictatorship,using as evidence the fraud in mayoral elections in some provinces of Argentina, the government's unwillingness to act against this displeased the military, who began a large rebellious military mobilization where divisions that were commanded by these generals attacked barracks and bases in a surprise attack and several aerial battles were indicated with Argentine fighters fighting each other, and to make matters worse, worryingly close to Buenos Aires, the main demands of the military are at least greater attention to the Peronist danger or even the resignation or impeachment of Rua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
rua2 = the rebel forces of the military that acted call themselves "Argentine National Forces" they bombed the city of Rosario and began a massive march in order to capture the city, the revolt that previously did not receive much attention from the government because it thought that the army would be able to handle now finds itself worried about the risks of the arrival of the ANF in Buenos Aires and a possible coup d'état,with this, the military demands yet another requirement regarding their wishes,the banning of parties that had ever been involved with Peronism and the absence of any punishment against soldiers,In the midst of this, diplomatic solutions will be discarded as the risks of a coup d'état or civil war will only be avoided in the event of an aggressive counterattack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

wnac = Major military revolts take place in Argentina where, due to the military's disrespect towards the new government of Fernando de la Rua,who remains blind to the danger of Peronism that is housed in churches and in the provincial town halls, they organized a mass revolt with their supporting army to launch surprise attacks against Argentine military bases., demonstrating their revolt against the silence of the new government that follows Balbin's legacy of forming a peaceful government but with high costs, causing problems such as inflation,As it is a completely military revolt, a counterattack reaction could lead to the degradation of conflicts and generate a civil war,however,still being practically the only risky option,since Balbin's assumption of power, his plan to pacify Argentina after the Peron era gave high costs such as inflation and currency devaluation due to the high costs of quotas and acts for policies and laws,Even so, Peronism continued to spread silently in the city halls of southern and western provinces of Argentina which culminated in the aggressive military reaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

echague2 = among the Christian Peronist parties, the idea of forming an internal coalition to form a cabinet was extended to the Power of influence of Echague,despite the consistent current of support among them,they still have a great rivalry against military generals who blaspheme Perón,in view of the old news and events, there will come a time when these generals will react to this new government of Echague whether militarily or not,until the coalition was formed, Echague applied a strategy of appointing a Peronist war minister to make any chance of a coup more difficult,but even so, Echague has not yet ruled out the idea of negotiating with the generals even if it involves imposed limits,with all this having as main stance a pragmatism so that nothing goes wrong and the blame lies with the ideological bias that blinds the chances of success,and when the coalition is formed, it may give the generals a bad look but it can still strengthen the bond and Echague's cabinet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
echague3 = a meeting held in Buenos Aires bringing together the main names of the proposal was decisive in the creation of the coalition,with everyone agreeing on the creation for the same purposes, although some secretly or not agree with the creation for their own benefit or oligarchic spheres,the coalition can strengthen the Government and the cabinet to at least maintain a peaceful government without military interventions,with the creation of the coalition, called the "Christian coalition",Echague was quickly invited to be the leader of the coalition for the same reasons, it is not new for an Argentine government to have oligarchic ideas and actions that are disguised as coalitions,although,the entire Argentine church, the priests' movement, the Christian parties that donated their piece to Echague and the anti-Peronist military make only Echague think twice before taking attitudes and make the same mistakes as in Argentine history,being a certain indecision about its entry, but in the midst of so many questions like a scale,any of the decisions may have unexpected effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
ccechague = Echague decides to join the coalition,being honored by the members who appoint him leader,being a step towards the era of Echague and his Christian Peronism but a great risk in the case of the military,Echague had already described this situation as being on a broken bridge over a lake of alligators,with the same being forced to be cautious about his actions,,because despite his more humane and progressive ideas,Perón's treacherous soul of despotism still remains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

palestinew = the forces of the Palestinian army with Syrian assistance emerge victorious from the war,with a ceasefire and control of the southern region of Israel, connecting the Gaza Strip with the others,the Palestinian army celebrates the victory, however, the war may not be over, with the ceasefire whose date has not been determined,any surprise counterattack may occur in the future,with this future being able to be a new war or a conflicting peace from a peace agreement that was never made,and according to the army,it will be difficult for Israel to counterattack any time soon,then through this the stages of assimilation with the southern region will be carried out, with the containment of revolts and the Islamization of the region,but at the same time prepare for a new front to open up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
israelw = Israeli forces managed to defeat Palestine in a convincing manner,the most up-to-date American support equipment was decisive against the Palestinian militias,with both regions of the Gaza Strip and cisjordania being occupied, with a new military occupation government being declared,perhaps being a probable end to Palestine,As long as no Palestinian diplomat appears who is willing to negotiate, the regions will be under Israeli control. and in the most cases, a total takeover with no chance of independence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

israelev1 = Haganah paramilitary army troops attacked some cities within the Palestinian territory with armed clashes on the border and inside Palestine,some recurrences of military presence from within the city of Jerusalem were also made,the haganah since its creation denied the existence of the left wing within Israeli politics,in addition to their ideals more similar to other Palestinian military groups where they desire the extinction of Palestine for considering the region Prophetically Jewish,since the "appeasement" of the region after the uprising conference and the determination of the borders,the hanagah disagreed with the peaceful policy because for them,adopting a mindset that your neighbor would be at peace would only be an obstacle to any surprise attack,with the group having one of its main leaders Yigal Allon, the group already had a presence in the region, but was never taken seriously by the Israeli authorities,Several clashes were held for the Palestinian authorities to contain the group,but no negotiations were made,and now, the haganah group has carried out lightning attacks on several Palestinian towns and cities,presenting its surroundings in a chaotic manner,since before that, the group had only dispersed as militias that occupied small regions, where the Palestinian army did nothing to contain them,and with the new attacks, perhaps the Israeli authority will react, passively or not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
kharms = Kharms arrived at his residential building, with his head full of questions,he unconsciously and monotonously arrives at the place and puts away his things, however,when he arrives in his dimly lit main room, the lights on the lamp suddenly come on,revealing that Kazikov was there, sitting in an armchair waiting for him,Kharms is startled by his presence and immediately asks what he wants,       "What was agreed upon some time ago?".      Kharms gets confused "I didn't break the agreement, I swear on everything that I didn't say anything to anyone".  Kazikov then gives a small laugh "Are you sure? Your district started to show opposition to us, something it never did before, strangely, this started to happen after our first meeting".           Kharms then breaks out in a cold sweat "we returned the documents, our opposition is just an ideological difference,we have always been left-wing"   Kazikov then replies "Well then, I believe you, however, I'm not here exactly because of that, but rather,that you read the documents and that's why you want to stop us,And...that's why you know too much" Kazikov then pulls out a gun from his own shadow and points it at Kharms and freezes "So, do you have any last words?" In the midst of this, Kharms thinks about how to get out of this but realizes that there is no going back, running was too risky, and then, Kharms says in a convinced way, accepting your destiny "Heh, I once knew a soldier, a former combatant in the unification wars, who witnessed the collapse and return of Russia,he was being treated in a psychiatric ward,and this man once said to me:Russia is not a nation, it is a calamity,Even though we are united, inside, we continue to fight wars as before, like a curse, and that's when I realized,even if your dream, Kazikov, of restoring the Soviet Union is realized,calamity had knocked on your door and you won't get out alive" Kazikov looks at him questioningly but then pulls the trigger,hitting Kharms' head which kills him instantly,the gun was silenced, the noise was not zero, but the building would not think it was a shot,Kazikov then leaves through the window, leaving Kharms' body,later,Shostakovich was in his office when Sakharov entered,He wanted to say something, so he sits at the table in front of Shostakovitch and speaks in a dejected tone "Kharms was murdered",Shostakovitch initially refuses, but when he sees Shakarov's serious expression, he comes to his senses,lowering his head and lamenting in silence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
skharms = Kharms arrived at his residential building, with his head full of questions,he unconsciously and monotonously arrives at the place and puts away his things, however,when he arrives in his dimly lit main room, the lights on the lamp suddenly come on,revealing that Kazikov was there, sitting in an armchair waiting for him,Kharms is startled by his presence and immediately asks what he wants,       "What was agreed upon some time ago?".      Kharms gets confused "I didn't break the agreement, I swear on everything that I didn't say anything to anyone".  Kazikov then gives a small laugh "Are you sure? Your district started to show opposition to us, something it never did before, strangely, this started to happen after our first meeting".           Kharms then breaks out in a cold sweat "we returned the documents, our opposition is just an ideological difference,we have always been left-wing"   Kazikov then replies "Well then, I believe you, however, I'm not here exactly because of that, but rather,that you read the documents and that's why you want to stop us,And...that's why you know too much" Kazikov then pulls out a gun from his own shadow and points it at Kharms and freezes "So, do you have any last words?" In the midst of this, Kharms thinks about how to get out,and then Kazikov says "last words?"Kharms remains silent but suddenly, he runs in a detached manner towards another room, with Kazikov desperately shooting, however, missing the shot,as Kazikov was sitting, he took a while to react,Kharms enters his room and without thinking twice he throws himself out of the window, breaking it, even if he fell from the third floor,He soon recovers and starts running aimlessly again,Kazikov enters the room and comes across the broken window, already knowing that Kharms left through there, however, he could not go and see where he was going, as exposing his face in the window could reveal him to witnesses who might have seen Kharms jumping,with Kharms surviving his death for the second time,He runs towards a road in front and calls for a taxi that was arriving and he tells the driver to go to a location that led to Shostakovitch's apartment,arriving there, he then enters desperately looking for his room,Finding and knocking on your door,when Shostakovich opens,When he realizes it was Kharms he immediately asks why he was there,with Kharms responding "we need to talk"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n. 
shost = the day after Kharms' death,Shostakovich meets with the district, with one chair to spare,informing everyone about Kharms' death,with Khivarevich and Weinberg not believing what happened, as it was something unexpected,amidst the lamentations, Shostakovich says "yeah.......I know....it was sudden,but what to expect from Russia,Well....I gathered you here because we have to get out of this, like....give up on deposing Batov and run away" Weinberg then becomes indignant at the decision "Why?

However, as Hall was the main name of the left-wing movement, Itliong took over the position and as there was no evidence that he was involved in the attack,he was not arrested, demonstrating his disagreement with Hall's plan, demonizing him and giving condolences to the victims,But even though Itliong is the main name now, the CIA and the Pentagon are keeping a close eye on him.and with that, Itliong found himself forced to reformulate his ideals not only because of the CIA but also because he realized that his old idealization of Hall was going beyond its limits.and since the attack of 75, Itliong Started Adopting a more reformist practice,and with the policy implemented and approved by the congress made by Henry M.Jackson, he was allowed to participate in the elections and therefore, even with Itliong in the game, the 76 elections will be considered peaceful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
usa_ev2 = Romney today met with his cabinet at the White House to discuss his plan to maintain order in the '76 election,with the terrorist attack made this year,American domestic politics became quite turbulent, with the insanity and extremism that an ideology could reach,with the meeting, several ideas were made to ensure that the 76 elections were calm,because a former follower of Gus Hall, responsible for the terrorist attack, would run for election,and even with the CIA and the Pentagon keeping an eye on him, some limits will have to be imposed to ensure that Larry Itliong does not cross the line such as his ban on citing Gus Hall in his campaigns and also his ban on using anti-American and extremist speeches,but even so, some members of his cabinet thought that Itliong would easily comply, as he adopted a more reformist and negligent practice against Hall's ideology,with himself already saying in public that he was against the idea of the attack and that after Hall was arrested, he declared himself independent and that he will free the American left legally under the law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

Jackson, a progressive and presidential candidate, proposed the law called "Balance of All America",a law that suggested the proposal that every election have at least one candidate and a different ideology,The idea was to propose a more democratic environment despite the differences and that every American could at least think about voting for someone who represents them better,Generating a new political era, where the country would pass from hand to hand to each side of right and left politics,No one doubted that Jackson would think this kind of thinking, since he is a progressive, with some being against it as it could be risky to open up space and opportunities for more extreme parties and politicians and others who agreed as this could stabilize the internal situation, especially after the terrorist attack against the CIA,with at least one left-wing party or politician representing the movement as a whole,kind of signaling a more neutral ambiguity in the face of the persecution that could happen against leftists and vice versa,with at least the most radical having a representative to call their own                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
indoev1 = Since Hatta took office as president of revolutionary Indonesia to depose Sukarno ,it was never certain whether his government would be what everyone wanted,Not even Hatta guaranteed that he would take charge of the revolt since there were rumors that he had been forced to take over the position,after Sukarno's defeat and Indonesia's entry into the OFN,Hatta's government stood like glass where any mistake could be fatal,The lack of structure and plans for post-Sukarno Indonesia has left the country quite economically fragile,and Hatta's lack of preparation has caused both his credibility and trust to be undermined by the population,At the end of the war, Indonesia was plunged into crises and revolts that were contained but at great cost,,after years of government, what would be a prophecy of non-aligned politicians became reality,A New Economic Crisis grows in Indonesian banks due to hyperinflation that has increased more and more due to the uncontrolled printing of money to buy and finance quotas and administrative-economic actions to sustain post-war Indonesia and contain popular and military uprisings, the government's unbridled printing of money caused Indonesian currency be undervalued, in addition to the costly patrol operations of the OFN in the Java region,Causing a drop in the popularity of the Hatta government, which in the midst of this is not knowing how to resolve the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
indoev2 = After all Indonesian televisions announced the new economic crisis, the burning fire of the agendas was disturbed in the parliament,with the right to insults,With Hatta's cabinet having to defend itself as much as possible against the accusations and disapproval made by the non-aligned politicians who practically formed alliances to depose Hatta,since they considered him incompetent and leaving him in office would only make things worse,However, the situation was so bad that if Hatta were to be aggressively deposed, the revolts that were contained would return strong and any new government that presented itself would not be able to resolve the situation.with the disagreements, Hatta decides to abolish parliament and declare a provisional state to give himself time to think about the solution,something that clearly did not please the opposition, comparing this decision to Sukarno's authoritarian method and using this to impose enmity on the population, accusing Hatta of being the new Sukarno and that if he continues in power, everything would be centralized around him and the population would die of hunger due to hyperinflation,With the damage done, Hatta decides for an all or nothing, speaking in a lecture that he didn't even want to be there and that he was forced to preside over Indonesia by order of military men who were against Sukarno,but even so, he says he is trying to solve hyperinflation and if revolts break out, let them know that he tried                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

wnindow = An economic crisis has grown in Indonesia as a result of hyperinflation caused by rampant spending and money printing by the government of Mohammed Hatta,After the Sukarno era, the unstructured democratic government worked in its new era as the new Indonesia, investing in its reconstruction and containing popular revolts that remained after the civil war, in addition to the OFN's military patrol operations on the island of Java to capture war criminals and guerrillas,with the devaluation of Indonesian rupiah, Hatta's government gained total disapproval from the parliament which resulted in its abolition, later,military movements were made on the island of Sulawesi by soldiers and divisions who did not accept Hatta's governance and who planned the occupation of several cities on the island and the declaration of a Republic with Djamin Ginting being the main leader of the revolt and with the announcement of these military personnel, a new civil war will happen soon and will certainly affect the entire economy of the region,thus marking another era in Indonesian history                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
feinev1 = Eduard Alexandrowitsch Von Falz-Fein,but also known as falz-Fein is a businessman, journalist and public figure who was born in Ukraine,But he moved to Liechtenstein, where he developed his sports and journalistic practice, however, he had to flee the country after the threat of the Nazi presence at the time,fein fled to Russia and moved to the city of Sysolsk in Komi,There he developed an important role in Soviet propaganda despite not having opened himself up as a communist or anything like that, having his work done in exchange for payment,When Russia fell apart in the late 1950s, Fein spent his days isolated with his family in a place far from the metropolis for fear of the chaos that soiled the region,After the Komi Republic was declared, Fein returned to the metropolis and used his knowledge and learning as a businessman to help the economy of Komi, becoming highly respected by the politician,When Komi fell to Soviet hands again, Fein secretly helped some important politicians hide from the WRRF regime and when the Black League unified Russia,Fein was not considered important enough to be on the list and be considered a forgivable politician or not,living as a mere businessman and journalist,Now, Falz-Fein has achieved the impossible, he has assumed the presidency of all Russia through his appointment of close political friends who are part of the Komi district,this is because the district was under accusation of corruption and money laundering and a victory by one of the members would be suspicious,So, Falz-Fein was appointed as a neutral politician, being there to be the wall of the fight,despite his close relationship with some members of the Komi district like Katushev                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
feinev2 = After his appointment as chairman, Fein was congratulated by the members of the Komi district, including strong hugs and laughter,demonstrating that he had no rivalry with anyone from there,After his appointment, Fein was invited to a meeting on the Katushev Guard,now that he had supreme power over all of Russia, no other district wanted to touch him,Even if you didn't agree with the ARPC's decision,In the meantime, Fein thought about what this meeting would be for and he suspects it is to invite him to officially join the Komi district since he got his position through appointment from Katushev,However, there are enough positive points if you enter the district,The district is known for being practically the most democratic in Russia, as it is home to democratic and liberal politicians, rather than military personnel and ex-combatants,With its entry, the district would gain greater political power and influence throughout the Komi region, something that would benefit your acquaintances,However, the decision will bring an oligarchic influence to the district, since it will be composed only of oligarchs and their decision will be more for their own benefit, breaking a little of their old social norms from when he was in Liechtenstein,but, with the help of the district, his sports company that he founded in the 60s will benefit greatly from the district's economic assistance,but of course all this will have a price, if you join the district he will have to face accusations of corruption and greater suspicions since he entered the district shortly after being appointed by the ARPC,putting his political and business career at risk,the decision is yours                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
feinev3 = Fein decides to go to the meeting, in short, it wasn't what he expected, the meeting was to talk about the plans that Fein could make for his government, since the district couldn't interfere directly in this, after the meeting, Katushev again invites Fein to another place, this time, to a common park,with both of them meeting on a bench facing a river and next to a dry tree,The reason Katushev invited Fein to that more private occasion was precisely what Fein had thought,he invites Fein to join the De Komi district, however,not for other benefits, but rather, because their presence and power could practically save them from dissolution,and then with that, Fein is kind of surprised about the likely fall of the district but Katushev explains about the scandal of accusations and that they are almost on the crow's beak because they did not have completely concrete evidence that the accusations were false, however, the accusers had evidence that was dated a few years after Russian unification of the involvement of embezzlement and money laundering coming from former Komi politicians.              "with your presence in the district, it will not be a certainty and much less will it nullify the evidence, but it will be able to silence and pacify our situation for a while until we are able to defend ourselves,remember mozorov? yeah,Today he is living in Samara because he was exiled and demanded to be removed from Sysolsk after his money laundering was discovered,and now his shit has fallen on our backs and they are very suspicious that we are doing the same,They noticed the strange low movement in income for the army and think that we are diverting money from the army because they are small and unstructured,but, I feel we can work this out, and your entry into the district could be a great help."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
feinev4k = After much thought, Fein decides to join the district, being welcomed by the members,With the news of his entry, Katushev's hypothesis came true, with the accusers appeasing, seeing the immensity of Fein's power, the accusers saw him as a bodyguard,with this, the increase in the number of times that meetings are scheduled will not be questioned, using this, the meetings will be held to gather evidence and proof of the district's innocence,With Fein's entry, the advertisements are portraying the district as a true oligarchic leisure since with Fein's power, the feeling of political superiority would transform the district into a oligarchy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
feinev5k = After a long time of research and investigation, the district finally finds proof of its innocence in the scandals,It was discovered through emails that those responsible for embezzling army income were actually using the name of the district to disguise themselves,with the real culprits being mysterious hackers and not politicians,making the evidence irrefutable and with the district not thinking twice about using this to their advantage,announcing to all of Russia the evidence found, discrediting the accusers and the judges responsible for the case, declaring the district innocent but still not failing to betray the evil looks of popular suspicion,but in the end, what matters was the release from the accusation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
batovev6 = Shostakovich's plan began to be put into practice,using its popularity to distribute more working-class and civic propaganda,the population already expected this,but they found this same attitude coming from Sakharov and Kharms strange,especially the population of Tomsk who saw shakarov himself as a liberal technocrat and Kharms being a supporter of the managerial state,but after some time the population only began to embrace this since within the ARPC the information was shallow,looking like a secret agency,until one day comes, and it was in it that the first step to create opposition against Batov began,amidst the passing of member turns for speaking time,Shostakovich used this time to begin his era of opposition against Batov's conservatism,being quite bold, but, as it was the first time, the indirect remarks, attacks and other things were almost minimal, with Shostakovitch only demonstrating disagreement with Batov's ideals,However, as he went on, Batov began to open up more about his ideals,being considered a military conservative that considering his past, his ideal of conservatism may have arisen with his military era in the Soviet Union,something that Shostakovich used delicately to become Batov's greatest opponent,claiming that his conservative ideals were pure populism because all of Russia already knew that he was once a general in the Soviet Union and even mentions that Batov has a hidden militarism, which was used to defraud the ARPC elections and increase his votes,with that, gradually other politicians from the Komi district began to show support for Shostakovich in a way that seemed to be something natural of course,like Konstantin Katushev and Igor Shafarevich,practically being almost a checkmate against Batov, since there were two entire districts against him which is not enough to knock him down, but it already causes a certain headache                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
batovev7 = with the success of Shostakovich's plan,the second step began to be put into practice, which was to start tarnishing its image and return with the guidelines on electoral fraud in the ARPC elections,accusing Batov of rigging the elections to win,having almost no evidence, but using the strategy of reminding parliament that he was once a general in the Soviet Union makes him credible,with the weakness of his posture, Batov questions himself about these attitudes  and how everything changed in such a short time with practically half of the parliament being against him,Batov then calls a meeting with his cabinet to discuss an idea to reverse this or try not to break his hegemony once and for all,on the way to the meeting,Kazikov and Viktor Leonov they meet quickly to agree not to tell Batov about the incident with the documents,since in the end, the incident occurred due to their incompetence,with the meeting taking place, a choice must be made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
coalitionbatov = After the meeting, it was decided to create a new coalition,fulfilling the minimum requirements and joining other military personnel more sympathetic to Batov,with this, the Sverdlovsk District Coalition is formed having Batov as leader,with the consolidation of the district, some prevention can be done, from here, if Batov leaves power he will still maintain a significant influence in his district, not being the total end,with the consolidation of the district, greater means of propaganda and dissemination are made, previously difficult because Batov was only from an office within the ARPC,with more conservative labor propaganda being spread in Tyumen, Sverdlovsk and Omsk,but also, declaring almost a cold war from within Russia, with the districts of Sverdlovsk and Tomsk disputing influence, however, Tomsk had the advantage, as it had almost total support from the district of Komi,being a 1 against 2,with both sides disputing their influence and hegemony in the other districts, leaving more neutral ones, such as the Urals, Novosibirsk and Chita districts,Even with all this, Shostakovich still had the nuclear weapon in his hand, which if used would be the end of his opponent, which was the documents,Before secretly handing it back, Shostakovich created copies of the documents to use to his advantage, but,I couldn't use it now, as it could cause a big commotion that could affect them too,in addition to the risk of them being targets of silencing and purging, a classic Soviet practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
coalitionbatov2 = In the midst of an ordinary day for Russia,Batov was in his office working as usual, until someone knocked on the door and revealed himself to be Kazikov,he wanted to have a private conversation with Batov, his real intentions are against Batov about the incident without it looking like it was their fault,because for Kazikov, Batov was not taking the fight between them with Tomsk as seriously as he should have,and with Batov's knowledge of the Tomsk district's suspicions of knowing his plans, perhaps Batov should start taking this more seriously and think of a way to defeat them,                                                               "Batov, I.....want to talk to you alone".   Batov then stops what he is doing and signals Kazikov to sit down and move on.        "So, you know we are practically in a cold war within Russia against Tomsk and Komi,but in the midst of this, I began to suspect some things,I began to realize that the Tomsk district began to be our rival almost instantly, as if they knew of our plan and wanted to weaken us to prevent it"                   with that, Bato then questions Kazikov "and what makes you suspect this?".                       then Kazikov responds revealingly "It may seem like a delusion or a strange suspicion, but no, I really think they know something, because,Andrei Sakharov began to adopt a more left-wing stance along with Shostakovich,doing a brief research, Sakharov was considered a liberal technocrat at the time he was a politician in the Tomsk Republic in the 60s".          Before Batov says anything, Kazikov adds something else, being a checkmate on his suspicions.     "And before you say anything else, I still have one more thing.".    then, Kazikov pulls a book out of his briefcase,   "THE JOURNEY OF THE END OF THE WORLD,written by sakharov in the 50s,This here is his biography, where he tells his journey up to the moment he began living in Tomsk in the pre-war era of Western Russia and I read this book and discovered something curious".    kazikov opens the book and looks for a specific page   "Chapter 20 to 23, this is nothing more than Sakharov repudiating the Soviet Union and recognizing the occurrence of the Ukrainian Famine in the 20s and 30s, and the gulags,with himself declaring himself a guy against Stalin's doctrine And that's where I ask you, how can a guy who wrote a book saying he hates the Soviet Union, simply not everyone starts being left-wing and supporting the ideas of the proletariat as well as the Soviet union itself?".             Batov just remains silent, so that it seems that several dots in his head connect, giving a sign that Kazikov was right,          And then Batov asks. "and how do you think they found out about it?".       Kazikov then replies, "I have no idea, but I know one thing, we must stop them somehow."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
pragbatov = After the meeting, an idea of posture was made,It was not agreed to create a coalition, as the already high fragility and popularity of the cabinet could cause consequences,but then, Batov decides to break his own moral standards,and to maintain posture and your position of power,Batov should administer Russia in a way that depends on the situation, being a pragmatic stance, adopting ideas and attitudes that even if they violate his moral or ideological code, but that can be the way that can adapt to problems,and even if its type of government is more unbalanced between liberal, socialist and militarist policies,could be a good position for Russia's improvement with the adaptation of problems, moreover,Batov's more pragmatic stance could generate doubts among his parliamentary rivals about his real ideologies, seeing Batov himself adopt liberal attitudes could make them question about what Batov really believes, making the opposition lose credibility, as it could think that the accusations are mere populism against a scarecrow thus being a good move in chess                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
batovev1 = Pavel Batov's victory in the ARPC elections proved to be quite turbulent,Even though Batov is on the list of generals pardoned by the Black League, his career as one of the leaders of a Soviet lord in the Urals made his name quite suspicious among the most convinced of the Yazov doctrine,with his victory, a turmoil over accusations of fraud and manipulation of the vote and influence before parliamentarians is growing, as they consider it a big mistake to organize this type of election in the midst of a council formed in a short time,among the most convinced of the doctrine or even those who feel resentment towards the former Soviet Union consider that demonstrating their ingratitude and rivalry against Batov It is something that cannot be fixed because he was precisely on the list of those pardoned by the regime more to fill empty positions in the face of the Black League's needs,with even Russia becoming one, the spirit of rivalry and survival of the 60s is still present within the great nation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
batovev2 = Among the group of politicians who consider themselves against Batov's position,one of them began to stand out for a controversial polemic,Dmitri Shostakovitch,known for being one of the main names of the Tomsk District Coalition, being recognized as the main name of the Tomsk Humanist Party,Shostakovich called together the members of his coalition and others to discuss a revelation he had encountered in the midst of to documents that were left unintentionally,Shostakovitch joined a meeting room with Daniil Kharms,Sakharov,his ministers and party members with the Komi District Coalition,with the meeting not being able to be reported to Batov,there, everyone wondered what the meeting was for, with Shostakovitch's way of being mysterious,made the meeting members fear something giant or troublesome,and then, Shostakovitch arrives in the room, everyone notices in his hands a small card of sheets folded as if they were documents,Shostakovitch sits down at the table and begins to explain himself.                                       "Gentlemen, first of all, I apologize for summoning you in such an uninformed and dramatic way,However, I discovered something that could really cause problems, but not for us, but for Batov,A few days ago, an ARPC meeting took place regarding some internal matters,As everyone knows, we are in a bonfire against Batov because of these accusations that you already know,So when the meeting was over, I ended up staying there for a while to talk to some agents,but I noticed something, at the exact same table where one of the members close to Batov,I had these documents that I have in hand,I went there and got it, first of all, I wanted to give it to him because he had forgotten,but, I noticed something on one of the leaves that was sticking out,".                                             Sakharov then he asks, "and what would that be?".                                                     Shostakovitch doesn't say anything, he just makes a gesture, throwing the documents across the table so that the pages inside are pushed out by the force of the impact,revealing what was there,and there among the sheets, it was written in what looked like a title in large letters. "Project RSMAR"       which, translating all the acronyms, becomes "restoration of the Soviet mother of all republics"        Everyone at the table was amazed at what it was, and then Shostakovitch added.         "We have problems here, but not for us"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n.
batovev3 = Daniil Kharms was in his private office in Tomsk,on the tenth floor of a reserved hotel,He was sitting at a desk, sorting out some paperwork about future district occasions,when suddenly, he feels something cold and metallic on the back of his neck, it was a weapon,when he realizes,It was Vasiliy Kazakov,one of the members of Batov's cabinet,somehow he had broken into the building to get to Kharms.                                                then,Kharms slowly raises his hands in surrender and without making any sudden movements with his head and then asks "what do you want?".                         Kazakov immediately responds "where are our documents?".              kharms soon tries to act uninterested "I don't know what you're talking about".                  Kazakov doesn't fall for the trick and quickly responds "I know that it was your district that picked up the documents that were forgotten at the last meeting, we saw that one of yours was the last one left".                                                              Kharms is stressed in his conscience, as they had already planned to put the documents back in the exact same place so as not to generate suspicion, but they took too long and then Kharms soon questions "And what is in these documents that makes you come here and point a gun at the back of my head?".                                                    Kazakov responds "These are important matters in our office, questioning in this way is the quickest and most direct way, you know that if you lie, your grave will already be dug".                                           Kharms then realizes that there is no turning back from the lie and begins to be bold "hehehehe, so.......you want to restore the Soviet Union?".                                Kazakov then gets stressed "Did you read what was there!?,you little shit!".                       Kharms remains bold "It's not our fault if you forget something so important in the middle of the council".                               Kazikov then takes a deep breath and calms down, as he knew that killing Kharms right there would be very suspicious and could lead to his office being investigated  "Listen, let's make a deal, tomorrow, on a way to return the documents and don't tell anyone else about this and also don't tell them that I was here.".                                           Kharms then agrees "Ok, I accept, however, let's agree that we are now in an internal conflict that must be hidden from everyone,because both I and the others from the Tomsk district do not want to see that hammer and sickle on our flag again".                                                  Kazikov then lowers his weapon and puts it away, slowly leaving the room in the darkness "so we'll see"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
batovev4 = The next morning, Shostakovich managed to return the documents without arousing suspicion,entering parliament earlier than everyone else and putting the documents in exactly the same place and position as before,with that, he sits in his place and waits for the rest of the members to appear, of course, acting naturally,after some time Alexey Radzievsky appears in parliament, being the second to arrive,Shostakovitch pretends to be natural while he glances at Alexey's steps,with him heading to his place, soon realizing the forgotten document and picking it up,with him looking around in a rather questionable way,confirming Shostakovich's suspicions,After several minutes, the parliament was already full, with the majority present,with Batov in front of everyone as the president,for everyone, that was just another ordinary day, but for Shostakovich, the atmosphere had never been as heavy as before,millions of things go through Shostakovich's head,Does Batov know about the incident? Will he try to silence us? Does he know that I was the last one to leave the parliament from the last meeting? Will he ask me something about it?,but among all the questions there was in his mind,"How will I stop them?" Shostakovitch looks to the side and sees Kharms sitting, by his gestures, he also seemed nervous,but little did Shostakovitch know that the reason for his nervousness was another thing,And then, after much thought, Shostakovich has an idea,create an opposition,not to tell everyone about Batov's plans, but rather to strengthen and use his accusations of fraud as the main agenda to bring him down,to thus prevent him from restoring the Soviet Union,with him planning another meeting with his district to organize a strong opposition to bring the rest of the Komi together without looking suspicious and make a move to impeach Batov                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
batovev5 = After the end of one of the meetings, Shostakovich summons only his district for a new meeting,Everyone knew the reason, but curiosity arose when Shostakovitch explained that he had an idea to stop Batov,                                                "Next, we all know about The documents and such, with that, after thinking a lot, I had an idea,Batov came to power because of the ARPC elections, so he is not an absolute leader, so I want to unite us all to create an opposition, but not to get up from the chair and point the finger at Batov and say he wants to restore the Soviet Union, no,Now, we are in a crisis of tension because when he won the elections, the other members of other districts began to accuse him and suspect fraud and manipulation, so his career is already tarnished,mainly because of his history of being the leader of a Soviet Russian lord in the 1960s,Then, we can start working hard to gather evidence and approval from the other neutral members to form and gather a strong opposition and weaken him until he is impeached,Of course, we will not say anything about the documents, as we could put our lives at risk with some spy agency or even a hitman to silence us.certainly, the first to join us will be the Komi district, as they were at our meeting,but we must organize non-suspicious support and act as if their choice to support us is natural,What do you think?"   Sakharov, then speak "a great plan Shostakovitch, however, and if they start to suspect that we know something,because until now, our attitudes in parliament have been quite neutral, as have everyone else, but from one day to the next we started to be a big opponent and always wanting to move the opposition and make accusations,especially if this starts the day after they forgot their documents there,What could we do to pretend that we are just any opposition?"  then Shostakovich thinks and generates an answer.  "hmmmm.....I know, how about we do this slowly and gradually, but in the middle of this, start doing more left-wing propaganda and populism,Even though we are not so socialist,I myself am just a convinced humanist, but I reject socialism,but if Russia and they start to see us making left-wing propaganda and calling ourselves left-wing,They can use this as the reason why we are against them, as they are quite conservative What do you think Kharms?".     Kharms stood there, looking at the ground with an expression of anguish,We know why, but Shostakovitch and the others don't,Shostakovitch even when he called, did not respond,making him repeat his name louder and louder until he wakes up, until he gets scared "Hm!?", Shostakovitch notices his strangeness and immediately asks "are you......okay? is there something wrong?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

bramgd = in view of the decisions of Magalhães' office for the contingency plans of the PTB radicals,The manner and behavior of total concealment of the meeting caused suspicions and theories to be created,things involving aggressive containment or even violating human rights, according to the PTB itself,After the meeting, protests took place inside the STF parliament and in congress,with Rubens Paiva, also a member of the PTB Party, being the main spokesperson,even with that, the trigger point of the Brasilia flames started when Fernando Ferrari was arrested accused of involvement in the attack on the government building in São Paulo,Something that revolted the PTB who claims that this is a violation of freedom of speech and the use of lies or manipulation of facts to be used as an excuse to arrest political opponents,and in the face of the revolt, a second attack was made, this time in Rio de Janeiro,where it involved even more than molotovs and angry radicals,weapons and tanks were also present alongside the PTB, demonstrating the radicalization of the PTB to reach these levels of revolt,with radical rebels taking over the Rio de Janeiro state government building,With this attack, the chances of a revolt at an alarming level were increased, causing Magellan to declare a state of revolution and carrying out a self-coup d'état supported by the ARENA party, abolishing elections and giving almost total power of the three branches of government to Magalhães, beginning an unconstitutional dictatorship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
bramgp = After the meeting, rumors and theories arose with talk of planning violence or outright military containment,However, a week after the meeting, Leonel Brizola was invited by Magalhães himself to a meeting to negotiate the pacification of the revolts,negotiations that may involve greater autonomy or political space for the PTB,So, Brizola accepted,and in Brasilia, they met to decide on their divisions that could cause problems for both sides,at the meeting, a larger budget and representation space for the PTB in the chamber was proposed,in addition to the proposal that Brizola could become one of the heads of congress so that they have the right to contest more effectively,something that the PTB would like, however, its non-political supporters saw this as a characteristic of a true despot,offering crumbs or great fortunes to silence your opponent, so that it appears that all this is his and his alone,as if his decision was absolute and the entire chamber, the three powers and Congress were in the palm of his hand,but, for Magalhães, this does not matter, since his objective of pacifying the party that had been the biggest problem was completed,something that also calmed the streets for civilians ,taking a break from the storm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
mpev = in view of the tensions occurring within Brazil caused by Magalhães Pinto's victory in the elections,a new era of dictatorship begins with Magalhães carrying out a self-coup, abolishing elections and concentrating the three powers in himself,All this was caused by the military takeover of the government building of the state of Rio de Janeiro, carried out by radicals and military personnel associated with the PTB party, represented by Leonel Brizola,with the risks of a large-scale revolution to the level of civil war, Magalhães desperately applies the coup so that the entire national government structure is not broken internally,because he knew that with the taking of the building, other revolts would happen around the country, and with the destructuring of powers and governmental power, the Magalhães government could break with the revolt and cause its fall,also that both the PTB and the most radical left-wing movements want his head,with the beginning of the dictatorship, the way to contain the revolt could be done however he wanted, without anyone being able to punish him,with the entire nation turning into their amusement park                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

gaiev2 = Protesters and organized protests began to take place in the south,in times of silence caused by the new Granada regime,The gaitanistas will finally be able to protest and gain strength in the face of the internal war against the Hurtado government being a big step towards the plan to break the power and establish a new gaitanista regime,Despite the steps that make the Gaitanistas party happy, this only shows even more reasons for the government to take this more seriously and start responding aggressively to everyone,With that, those mainly responsible for the insurgency plan are already considering breaking the government once and for all, with popular support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
gaiev3 = With popular movements throughout Colombia, the consolidation of power can be done in two ways: all or nothing or through good old dialogue,We all know the hatred we have against fascism, but causing a second civil war could be devastating for the country and even if we are victorious, the costs and future problems will give us headaches,apparently, the Hurtado government will not give up easily,However, they know that the majority are against them and political and military power is almost useless,the risk of going into dialogue and having it go wrong is great, which is why we are considering a total war but what matters most is the popular rise and the fall of the government of Hurtado and his allies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

hurdep = Hurtado is deposed by a military offensive led by London,his decision to abolish parliament had been the last straw for him,even though Hurtado had fought alongside Avendano in La Violencia,His ideas did not match Londono's consent, always giving Americanized conversational signals, according to him, of course,the abolition of parliament could have been a risk for the government, even if power was centralized in Hurtado, the government would still remain fragile,with the Gaitanists players being able to attack internally,with this move, Londono knew that the Gaitanists players could act now,but with the military government,the chances may decrease,Hurtado was sent to the interior of Colombia, where he was given the position of commanding military stations to assist the army.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

poujev1 = Pierre Poujade, a declared right-wing democrat, was elected in the elections of the new Republic,Being a talented populist who knows how to speak the language of the people,he conquered the people,although,your record is not clean, with cases of collaboration with the Vichy government,However, this did not stop him from running, as the accusations did not have sufficient evidence and he was not extremely extremist,Poujade began his career by fighting against state-imposed taxes,and from the beginning never hid his enmity with the bourgeoisie and the state,something a bit ironic coming from a right-wing politician,Poujade has plans for industrial development and his war against the 200 families,for him, the region needed industrial advances, due to years and years of destruction and war, something that delayed French technology,in addition to defending the worker and the minimum tax rate,with plans for designing policies and civil rights for industrial workers And the fight against the bourgeoisie which, according to him,enslaves the French worker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
poujl = Poujade announced his resignation as president,with the emergence of evidence of his involvement with the Vichy state and the unsuccessful industrialization plan that caused inflation due to massive money printing to cover the cost of building and financing national companies and industries in addition to the loans made with the United States that caused internal debt,his popularity declined,his exaggeration in accelerating the country's industrialization destabilized the nation that had just emerged from a civil war and an ethereal ethnocentric regime,Who will take over his post now is his Prime Minister François Ceyrac,also a moderate industrialist,who promises to try to fix everything and continue Poujade's plans, but in a calmer way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
yeltru3 = with the continuation of reform plans for the democratization of Russia, issues such as the prohibition of gulags and the lesser influence of the doctrine in schools are being discussed, despite the Yeltsin's democratic concepts and Yazov's doctrine are opposite,even so, the idea of the Continuation of the conservative military would continue,because the arrest or deposition of military personnel who consider themselves to be in the service of the black league could be a match in the gasoline and it would be a declaration of internal war,The questions of the destination of the two European vessels in the East were also opened,so that even if the black league falls, Russian influence and hegemony will still remain with the Dissolution of these states to heal nations under more democratic and liberalized Russian dominion,Although Yeltsin is against the regime and its doctrine, he recognizes the efforts made to end Germany and even supports its revenge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

sartreev1 = The transition from pre- and post-Burgundy periods shaped what would be a political revolution, with the collapse of the Burgundians and the entry of the new Maziere regime many ancient philosophers, historians and others entered politics in favor of developing their ideas in a desperate way for the nation,and one of the best known movements is the Sartreist party,founded by renowned philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre along with others such as Simone De Beauvoir and Albert Camus,philosophers who, amid the crises and Himmler's totalitarian regime, had gone into exile in the city of Le Mans,And with the philosophers meeting in the region, they decided to unite to fight against the Burgundian regime and spread their developed ideas to the nation,using as a basis its philosophical concepts such as existentialism and others,Jean Sartre and the Philosophers founded the party after the fall of Himmler and the victory of Albert Jacquard,the movement that was previously just guerrillas formed by anti-fascists, philosophical followers, students and workers founded the party to have a chance of winning his seat in parliament and soon his rise,Jean Sartre was known as "The Man of Gears" over time,this is because, Sartre with his more in-depth studies of humanism and a little loss of sanity believes that the common human being will be free to assert himself as an individual in the way he dreams of developing a technocratic, this is because the issues of individual freedom and dependencies were developed due to the lack of restorative technology,the greater demand for labor and the automation of everyday life to achieve the development they require,and with the advancement of technology, the creation of robots, machines and everything to replace forced labor offers greater opportunities for individual freedom conquering even a futuristic utopia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
gngs = The Failure of Defensive Sector Financing and the loss of credibility of Tomio Kubo and Mitsubishi has caused a question to be opened,in the face of the situation of increased growth of Kuomintang guerrillas the continuation of the kubo government may or may not be necessary, the sudden failure of financing and the economic destruction of the defensive sectors against the guerrillas could cause a domino effect that will lead to a crisis throughout the state rebellions, economic crises and the rupture of parliament may arise, however, all of this is nothing more than probability, since the guerrillas are secret agents who act in hiding, there is no exact idea of their size or how serious their failure was.Therefore, the question of whether or not to continue the Kubo government may be debated, having to take into account considerations of crisis prevention, something that is most likely to happen in addition to civil unrest with the decision of the declaration of martial law,and probably, with Kubo's departure, other appointed politicians may or may not take over the position that will deal with the crisis,what will be done?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

indcev = guerrilla forces from Calcutta and financed by Japanese intelligence agencies overthrow the newly elected government of shiv verma,Verma's Marxist and social ambitions challenged the interests and structure built around India,and with the problems involving ethnic and territorial conflicts in the regions of Bengal, the assumption of a future approval of independence of the region could cause a domino effect, and not only that,even if Bengal's independence is unlikely, Shiv Verma's ambitions and mindset could cause a future exit of Azad Hind from the prosperity alliance and also support and financing of guerrillas and communist movements in China,in short, the Japanese did not want a Marxist leader as president of one of the largest members of the alliance,and financed the guerrillas commanded by gurbaksh dhillon who demanded an ultimatum of Verma's resignation and his move to the Maldives,the joint military government of Dhillon will be a great opportunity for the entry and linking of Japanese influence in Azad Hind,and with the pro-Japan military government,Muslims who are calling for independence from Bengal will not be happy about this, something that could cause future problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

indev2 = with the victory of shiv verma in the azad elections,a strange mobilization is being reported in the regions of Bengal,The authorities, together with Verma, find this strange, but exclude the possibility of it being a popular mobilization coming from the Bengali Muslims,since shiv verma is a self-proclaimed marxist and has always defended the will of the people and the workers,and it was obvious that he was a populist who loved cane,Shiv Verma ordered an espionage expedition in the region to try to find the presence of any notable military personnel and even those who were part of the national army,with the investigations,the odisha military intelligence group eventually found the officer of the Indian National Army Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon,something that alerted the verma government,because he was a renowned officer and had contributed greatly in the Indian war,and perhaps, with his presence in the mobilizations in Bengal, he may be planning something,Since it is something done in secret, it may involve the deposition of verma                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
sahgdi = after the Azad elections,Prem Sahgal,husband of lakshmir sahgal,was elected,and amidst the ethnic and territorial conflicts of Azad,sahgal began his government already in trouble,with his victory and his role as a commander served the Azad hind,the disputed sand regions of Islamic majority have demonstrated disapproval,because the Azad government before the unification,the Azad government was already practicing forced assimilations and repression of protests coming from Calcutta,the Muslim-majority Bengal region was essential to the existence of Azad Hind,so they wanted to keep the region at all costs, even with the protests calling for the region's independence,and now, with the rise of sahgal, they feared greater repression thanks to the growth of Azad's power after unification,and in front of the parliament of new delhi, the seats occupied by Islamists who supported the independence of the region became targets considered threatening to the sovereignty of Sahgal and Azad Hind as a whole,and sahgal as a last, more emerging alternative, abolished parliament and declared an interim military state,commanded by members of Sahgal's cabinet, including his wife,and in the face of the sole power of the Sahgal cabinet, and the repressions carried out in the Bengal region,the sahgal regime begins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
sakhevop2 = since sakharov's victory in the ARPC elections, he had complete freedom to study the muclear arsenal, having the possibility of being in front of one of them for the first time,and this caused him a spasm of fascination,Never in his entire career as a physicist did he have the chance to face a nuclear missile in the Modern Age,with that, their studies only became even more innovative,with his highest position in Russian politics, he had access to all the information about the studies and tests carried out by the Black League over time,and technology, innovation, the beauty of the inexplicable and scientific logic, all made for a weapon that can decimate thousands and millions and turn metropolises into ashesAll this left Sakharov on dopamine foam,with his desk now being full of sheets, something that pavel tcherenkov noticed, and left him concerned about Sakharov's dilemmas and obsession, afraid of breaking their moral rules to use weapons as they see fit,however, he still demonstrates sanity.                                                          sakharov:"I may even exceed Tcherenkov's limits, but I will never break my moral rules of life just to see fire mushrooms from afar"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
sakhevop1 = since sakharov's victory in the ARPC elections,he struggled with himself over his dilemmas,when he lived in Tomsk, together with other politicians such as Pasternak and Kharms,He was building a civic mentality, always defending civil rights tooth and nail.beyond technological objectives in general, both for military matters and for civic leisure,However, when he came face to face with the weapon he studied and was fascinated by so much, the desire to dive into it increases, he had always heard names, letters and numbers, but he had never seen them face to face,and realizing the level of the thing,He decides to take action, because he knows that if this falls into the wrong hands, the world will end,so he began to prepare a national law,that the use of nuclear arsenals will only be permitted in cases of invasion against the main territories,and no nuclear attack plan that is caused against the country that is being invaded by us is made,Despite the fascination, he knows that what he studies can decimate humanity in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

tci = Amid the crisis following the death of Chomanand in Thailand and the presence of the socialists,the fierce conflict over the succession of Chomanand was made,Luang W was chosen as the successor and among the quartet, he is the one who is least considered the "dangerous" socialists,but little did he know that this would be his downfall,chalermkiat watanangura,a renowned general did not accept the choice,because he is suspicious of your loyalty to the regime,with his indoctrinated mindset, watanangura suspected luang W,believing that he may be involved in a plan for socialist ascension,and he uses as further proof his mentality of considering socialists not so dangerous,and even if your supposed fragile loyalty is a lie,he foresees a second ascension from the inside out, and if the regime lasts long, it will be able to negotiate with the socialists and they will be able to indoctrinate and dominate the congress, the parties and everything else, until their leader is elected and the red terror begins,with that, watanangura along with other generals and divisions who were convinced or already didn't like luang carried out a coup d'état,declaring a second interim regime,Luang fled the besieged palace in time, and among the demands, Watanangura demanded Laung's departure from Thailand,with this coup, the socialist militias that sheltered the Thai borders attack several railways that connected to Bangkok, thus starting the Luang War                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

manc_ev1 = Since the Amur defeat amid the Russian unification wars,Many of the soldiers and generals who served Amur fled to Manchuria, where they had used it as a home since the 1930s to establish their party,and with the Soviet collapse after the war in Western Russia,they established their independent state in the Amur region,and with its sudden fall years later, they returned to the region,with this, Puiy's reign over the empire is in decline, with his health becoming precarious and the lack of stabilization in the region after the events of the Great Asian War,Russian fascist refugees begin to demonstrate their plans and interests in overcoming their dominance in the region,with the Manchurian communist party which denies Puiy's rule and dreams of spreading reformed neo-communism throughout Asia,with the Manchurian military knowing about it,they have already started to act under martial law and increased policing in less populated regions,demonstrating to the world that the threat of civil war in Manchuria is growing and can mark the end and beginning of an era                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

brit_ev2 = British Prime Minister Sefton Delmer announces his resignation from office,with an internal crisis growing in the face of accusations of corruption,Delmer chose to resign from his position because if he is arrested or forcibly removed, this will have a greater impact than his resignation,From the beginning of his term, he was aware of how the rebel juntas acted throughout the island and knew that the slightest breakdown in government could be fatal for the state,and his succession before his cabinet would be calmer, because,without the intensity of the conflict scale to reach his impeachment,there would be no bigger conflicts with more damage at the level of civil war,inside your office, is Pirie,Macnab,hawkins and Canning,all those who have already tried to defend Delmer from the accusations,However, their decision to resign is accepted by them and embraced as a fair decision,in the meantime of changing powers, the state order of burgundy support Pirie as being the most efficient, something that would give great influence among civilian British fascists,the older parties supported Hawkins, as he was a former member and also known as Oswald Mosley,and with macnab and canning being supported by the most reactionary fascists,with Macnab being a former WWI commander and Canning being the son of one of the former member of the first fascist parties,canning is known for focusing more on populism,Pirie is known for being the most Nazi rather than fascist, defending a technocratic nationalism and British superiority,macnab is the most reactionary, vilifying the world's progressive practices as being "demonic",Hawkins is known for being a reformist fascist,Since the beginning of his fascist career with Mosley, he has developed into an expert who believes in reformulating fascism for the new era and Canning being the "least worst", following in his father's footsteps but being notorious for his greater perception of what the fascist sphere is like, but still being a nationalist who wants the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.
negsuc2 = sending kibardin to Magadan and negotiating the conflict with the mercenaries proved to be efficient,can, it also proved to be a risky decision, because,with kibardin being a former head of government of the Magadan state in the mid-1960s,the mercenaries didn't like him very much,because he was already part of the Magadan government that crushed the 1960's coup attempt,and does not trust his presence as a negotiator,But, taking advantage of the situation, Kibardin proposed not only the release of the mayor of Magadan, but also a proposal for ties with the Yazov government,Werbell and his mercenaries are masters of negotiation and weapons handling,with this they can contribute to the black army with the negotiation of weapons for the government, in exchange, they will not hinder them in the independent negotiations of Magadan, with this, the mercenaries will be able to profit double or triple and not have the government on your tail,and not only that, but doing the passes with kibardin and starting to work together for your own benefit,of course, with the Russian Navy leaving its posts and letting the foreign arms export trail run freely without military intervention in the Magadan Sea,because with the Russian government being a customer, the demand for more weapons to sell will increase,With this proposal, Werbell heard it as a good deal, and decided to agree, releasing the mayor and demanding the removal of the army from the site, so that they can leave without deaths,and at the end of the negotiations, werbell suggested a diplomatic meeting with yazov in a week's time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
negsuc3 = sending Drozdov to fight the mercenaries who kidnapped the mayor of Magadan was a turning point in the escalating crisis,Since the 1960s, Drozdov has always shown himself to be a general who values quick and unique solutions,upon his arrival in the city, he ordered the organization of two divisions to go to the building where the mercenaries are located,the other commanders who were already in the region realized that Drozdov would react aggressively,Upon his arrival at the building, he ordered the mercenaries to retreat or they would be shot.with the mercenaries refusing and him knowing they were armed too,Drozdov ordered them to release the mayor within 1 minute and in the meantime, the divisions prepared to receive the order to storm the building,with the end of the minute, and without answers, Drozdov orders the invasion, with a direct cleaning plan, because he knew that in the meantime of one minute, they could already be changing position and even running away with the mayor,with the division coming face to face with the mercenaries on the sixth floor of the building,there being a Frank exchange of fire,and with the building in sniper's sights,Drozdov assured them that they would not get out of there alive,after 4 minutes of intense gunshot sounds,One of the division commanders reported on the radio that Werbell had surrendered, and that around 4-7 mercenaries had been killed,With that, the entire division leaves the building with the mayor intact and Werbell handcuffed,along with some other surviving mercenaries,the case was reported throughout the country and it was there that Drozdov began to gain the respect of the people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
afpkwar = a new armed conflict arises in the Asian region,Pakistan, a newly formed Islamic nation, has declared war on the kingdom of Afghanistan over allegations of abuse of authority we Afghan territories with Pakistani population,the northern Baluchi region and some parts of the center were in constant territorial conflict, with Pakistan claiming the regions because they had an Islamic Pakistani population and culture,in addition to the problems caused by the massive wave of Pakistani immigrants coming from Afghanistan for having been held and having their rights fulfilled,and now, with yet another aggressive military retaliation against the Pakistani-Baluchi people,Pakistani forces decide to act in a unique and punctual manner, without further discussion,now it's war,since Pakistan's independence and the acquisition of Afghan puppet territories,the massive wave of retaliation was the result of aggressive groups and acts coming from Pakistani peoples from regions that were not integrated into the country,who in turn were forced to live as Afghans through forced assimilation,and if this were to happen in a way that there would be no Pakistani retaliation, there could even be massacres against the Pakistani people, something that Pakistan wants to prevent from happening, since over time, the Afghan government has been increasingly aggressive towards the people, getting fed up with the demands, in addition to the diplomatic dispute coming from Pakistan,King Shah of Afghanistan declared that he himself had no involvement in the aggressive retaliations, and that this was the responsibility of the local military,demonstrating repudiation and support for the Pakistani people, however, not agreeing with Pakistan's attitude of invasion,since King Shah at that time did not have much power to do anything, and only demand that the peace negotiations be balanced and that they do not involve punishing the royal family for not being involved in this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
ofnmet = the first meeting of the political entities of the OFN was held in 1975,with celebrations because new members entered the game, Iran, Indonesia and the Philippines,with their seats already reserved.                             George Romney: "Comrades, welcome to the OFN headquarters!,today will be our first meeting after your entry into the alliance, thanks to the efforts and blood shed for freedom, you can now say what you think!".                                             Jose Avelino: "I am grateful for the reception, I understand your happiness, but I didn't want to break the mood, I have things to report, given the still Japanese presence behind me, I think the flag of my nation on the OFN membership list was not a sufficient reason for the Japanese to leave us alone,I was informed of the presence of their navy in my sea, I don't know what they want, but at the same time I don't want to know ".                                    John turner: "The Japs are smart enough to know that if they pass through the Philippines in the air, there will be trouble,I'm not saying to ignore them, but at the same time I can say that there is nothing to worry about,After the meeting, we will take measures to prevent anything from happening".                                         Despite the joy of seeing new members, discussions were heated about measures to prevent any retaliation against new members,The Philippines had most of its maritime zone bordering member nations of the Japanese Pro-President Sphere,Indonesia was still in intrigue against the Japanese colonies in Borneo, and Iran was in diplomatic conflict against Yazov's Russia, in addition to the esoteric Nazis of Türkiye, all of this was debated, and from the looks of it, will be the focus of OFN's actions in the coming months                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
thaidd = the current president of Thailand and leader and founder of the reactionary regime Kriangsak Chomanand I die due to a heart attack caused by age,He was quickly rescued, but there was not enough time to react, it was not possible to revive him and the main hospital that helped him is already taking steps to create his death bed,his death was a shock to supporters of the regime and the quartet, as he appeared to be a healthy man,but it seems that death wanted him now,the main leader of the quartet Dej Snidvongs Ah is taking immediate steps to avoid any internal conflict,He knows that this time could be perfect for the socialists to react and with that, they have already ordered the readiness of the army and vehicle divisions,a meeting will be held to decide the succession of chomanand, and being aware of the diversity of ideas of the quartet, the interim government council will have in its hands the decision that could change the course of the nation,Local military personnel who were infiltrated from the regions occupied by the socialists reported that the militias did not seem to be willing to react now,for they know that the measure of snidvongs will be made, and reacting fully as expected will not bring results and will cause losses and even the total extinction of the militia.something that relieves the quartet's backs,speaking of them, they met in a palace in Bangkok to measure decisions about any disagreement for the choice of succession,with snidvongs receiving pats on the back as a way of congratulating the quick attitude that resulted in the militias not reacting,                                        Thanin K: "Gentlemen, we all agree that we have different views from each other, despite being part of a reactionary government of the same nature,but, we must measure and nullify any disagreement between us for when the council decides the chomanand's succession".                                        Luang W: "I will have to agree, picking fights over council choices could backfire on all of us, in the end, no one will win in this".                                    Snidvongs: "I'll be honest, I would choose waithayakon for the succession, we know him as a man of the people who has the populist gift of the gab and sustains popular support, choosing him could be effective in maintaining the government's security structure".                                          thanin K: "So we have an agreement, no fighting, no intrigue, if the council chose, so be it"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
thailand_intro = In the late 1960s, due to intense political crises within the Thai government after the death of the king, a new regime was established along the lines of intellectual patrons,the growing tension within Thailand since its rise in the 1940s made some of its members rethink what should be done,the ancient soul of great Thailand that expanded on all sides was no longer the same,with the terror and fear of probable coups and massacres, the military known as "The definitive", emerged through aggressive forces, and with the support of bombing to disorient their opponents,the group managed to come to power with a coup d'état, and with the use of collaboration cycle plans between other collaborating groups called "the quartet",the regime managed to establish itself without leaving weaknesses for a counterattack,the regime was known as a reactionary nationalist government,who saw any political means of radicalization as a bad influence, and with this mentality, several socialist groups and militias began to retreat in the face of the government's aggressiveness against them,The year is 1975, and Thailand's internal political situation is being called the "phantom civil war",several regions further away from the metropolis were taken over by socialist militias that were against the government,and they wait for the first opportunity to react with everything,the reactionary government already has plans in place in case of replacement and would also prefer to keep the socialists contained in their occupied territories,so that they would not abuse the civilians in the area,because for them, keeping them contained in the corners of Thailand was cheaper and more efficient than keeping them in a total House to House Containment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
negfail = Negotiations in the face of the Magadan crisis were considered a failure, with that, the scale of the situation was increased to the level of war, since, with the decision to send General Sakharovsky to contain them,the mercenaries reacted, killing the mayor and fleeing, thus implementing a second plan in case this happens,Its second place of occupation was the government headquarters of Magadan, which now with the mayor dead, went into decline, with that, occupying the headquarters and reacting with diplomatic hunger, declaring the independence of Magadan, the Magadan war begins,commanded by werbell,the yazov government reacts immediately by sending divisions to the front,with the execution of plan B, the media and the government ask what they want with this,and werbell in front of a camera, declares his refusal to subordinate himself to yazov, and says that his plan B was executed thanks to the government's decisions,                                           "I didn't want to get to that point, however, the government's decision to send General Sakharovsky to respond to our negotiations aggressively was a declaration of war on us,and now, I know exactly how the government acts towards us businesses and that's why I declared the independence of Magadan,I know the government will retaliate against us, and I know I will be shot if caught,but I will fight, I and my forces will fight as far as we can and if we are victorious,we will start our own empire".

negsuc = Negotiations in the face of the Magadan crisis were considered a success, amid the kidnapping of the city's mayor,Moscow's envoys for negotiations managed to convince the mercenaries to release the mayor,the negotiations were that in exchange for the mayor's release, the government promised less military intervention in the mercenaries' business,However, they must be required to follow certain requirements to maintain balance, they will not be able to do arms deals that involve minors,and if the arms deal involves assassinations, the buyer must be required to execute the target discreetly and there must be no uninvolved victims and panic,only having to be done in discreet places and with the use of silencers,With this, the arms market will continue to run, the mercenaries will have their profit despite being smaller than before and the city will have greater security in front of the innocent,and the involvement of weapons will only be discreet, not causing fear or panic among the population,the diplomat sent by Guerasimov used a megaphone in front of the building where the mercenaries were sheltering the mayor,and with the proposal made, the mercenaries decided to release the mayor with an army escort in exchange for them leaving there without conflict and pretending that nothing happened,the mayor was released and walked in front of the main door of the building being ordered to keep his hands up and not to look back,while the army in readiness awaited any surprise attack,After he was assured that he was under control, the military decided to stand down and let the mercenaries leave,The case was covered by the entire media and was a landmark in the conflicts against the Black League government,despite the proposed demands, the government still has not taken its eyes off the mercenaries because they know that they may fail to comply with the agreement,and makes it clear that if this happens, there will be an aggressive response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
rus_ev3 = When Russia became one, several politicians and military men who had once been enemies of the league were subjugated as traitors,However, not all politicians were tried,The Omsk generals decided to conduct analyses on former politicians from other Russian lords to see if they would be useful within the government of the unified league,the most democratic politicians and not so extremist military men were pardoned on charges of treason,and now, they are part of the league's political game, as deputies,however, following restrictions on their ideologies as the only requirement being the non-propagation of extremist speech or scope that goes against the Omsk doctrine,politicians from Tomsk and Komi were the main ones pardoned for being from more democratic nations and spheres,even having politicians who changed their views thanks to their submission to the league,Those responsible for this pardon plan claimed that a massive execution or punishment of these politicians could harm the internal government of the league, with their lack, the political game could be fragile and its greater diversification could lead to both the popular will and the game of ideas that could define the future of the league in case a fight for power occurs,The chances of civil war between single military successors may be lower, and with the considerations of these forgiven politicians, the succession dilemma may be calmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
himmdec = Himmler is 74 years old, and as a result, his health has been gradually deteriorating, with him showing signs of weakness and mental slowness,demonstrating its stage of old age,with this, his main generals and politicians open up about the issue of his succession,because they knew that after his death, Burgundy could decline due to the lack of a fair collective structure, which is always present a one-man paternalistic structure,Wilhelm Mohnke was the first to realize this future problem,his paranoia about a supposed betrayal led to his loyalists being afraid to even hint at his succession,because they fear that Himmler might see it as a sign of treason to talk about succession and changing places,even though all the generals share the same esoteric Burgundian ideology,two disagreements about what is ideal for Burgundy make them exchange looks of distrust and challenge,and each day that passed, the exchange of glances turned into distrust and plans of betrayal,the Burgundian Ego doctrine caused its ideologists to practice tactics of political superiority,this could be avoided with help to give Himmler longevity of life,However, his paranoia meant that any sign of recommendation could be taken as treason,What remains for us is to hope that Himmler himself realizes that his days are numbered and begins to consider medical support,But that will only be a hope, you never know how far Himmler's ego will go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
bur_ev3 = Today was the meeting of the main generals of Burgundy to celebrate the anniversary of the Reich,what should have been a day of joy, became a scenario of discomfort,Later there was the banquet, the generals were at the table, with a silence that would kill millions,until Himmler arrives in the room, his health decline was noticeable,the generals immediately stood up and saluted him,all this seemed like a competition, everyone knew that blood would be spilled because of a mediocre old man,I would describe Himmler at that moment as Pandora's box,once fallen, it caused chaos,and I knew I could be the first to be betrayed,seeing those close to them as definitely future adversaries made me question what loyalty really is,However, I couldn't say anything, because even my most trusted assistant could betray me,and all that was left was for me to do was plan what to do when Himmler died,Would I run away, or would I try to gather as many supporters as possible to win the civil war?I only know that when the news of his death comes to light,I will be away for the first few days, because they knew they would take up arms to try to kill me, I didn't know who, but I knew it would happen.

mgd_crises = a group of american mercenaries commanded by mitchell werbell iii kidnapped the mayor of the city of magadan,before the unified reign of the black league,the Magadan mercenaries began to live together as black arms merchants,with his reign being mainly Magadan,in view of its arms business, the Yazov government has constantly been noting its presence in the region, damaging its business,With that, at the behest of Werbell, the mercenaries kidnapped the mayor of Magadan and demanded negotiations about the region, whether this will be diplomatic or military, it will be the government of the league that will decide,What worries the league most is that in the event of the mayor's death, Magadan's mercenaries could take over the government and lead to a larger-scale armed conflict,involving the entire Magadan province,the constant internal crises caused by rebels leaving deny Yazov's sovereignty make the government take measures according to what happened,they know that resolving this through diplomacy will be the best and most peaceful solution,but, there will be a great chance that the mercenaries demanded the absence of the military in Magadan, to continue their arms empire,This will be difficult to accept, but if it is proposed as their only strategy, there is nothing they can do but accept it,one of the most significant generals Lazarenko has already stated in interviews that the situation is extremely delicate, and will not involve a refugee, but rather, a probable military conflict that could cause a domino effect,and the worst case scenario, a civil war or a collapse from Magadan,Military solution measures could be taken, such as killing them and quickly containing them without time to react, but they consider this risky as it involves an internal group that camouflages itself from the civilian population of Magadan, being able to infiltrate or hide pretending to be civilians and knowing the place better than anyone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n.
usa_ev1 = Within the Adverse Situations of the United States of 1970's,One of the problems that has been growing is the rise and creation of extremist movements, mostly in the south of the country,Today marks 1 year since the Beligham case,Where a black man was murdered by members of the Klu Klux Klan,This was the key point for the beginning of waves of protests across the country calling for an end to extremist movements,Men and women, walking the streets consumed by fear of neo-fascism,also propagated by the Machiavellian tactics of past politicians,The White House's dilemma over responsibility for ridding the Americas of totalitarianism has made every move that could be against the White House and its minions worrying,especially when you consider that if the United States succumbs to fascism, there will be no other nation that can stand to be free,And what is most worrying about this is that the country is surrounded by both sides of the world, and mainly by the presence of Burgundy in Europe, even stronger and more threatening,certainly masters of espionage and mass control,and with that happened the well-known "fredoom flight",the much-escalated and important march against extremism,meaning that the American people were not controlled by the mass of external neo fascism,But to prevent this from happening, the United States is gradually transforming its OFN members into true puppets of war and trade, transforming the OFN into an alliance of an empire just like the Japanese and Burgundy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
jap_ev1 = The first meeting of the then known "businessmen" has just taken place,business and corporation owners, specifically the most profitable ones, gathered with Ohga and his ministers to discuss their business plans and activities for today's year,Ohga's capitalist mentality was showing interest to businessmen,because obviously his business empire would be valued as a pillar for the Japanese economy,and the rising arrow would be a dopamine machine for them and Ohga,However, other discussions were opened about not only business and money, but also the security and balance of the Scales between business and nation,because in the face of Ohga's administration, questions began to be raised among the population and the military about what Japan would become under a man of capitalism,Since the 1930s, Americans have been taught and shown a dislike of the Japanese, especially when war broke out, and now, with the OFN in the Philippines and Indonesia and a prime minister with a ideology known to be American worried conservatives and reactionaries who feared the future submission of the empire either to the OFN or to the Americans,in a military or commercial manner,which makes Ohga's safety debated, because with this prelude, conservatives and reactionaries may at some point begin to consider Ohga an enemy of the nation, and want his head,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

Werbell III,the so-called "pan-american mercenaries of the east" problems were arising about their presence, with cities like Magandan being subjected to a black market arms trade,and with the rise to power of Yazov and his supporters, faced with his ethnic-radical mentality,werbell began to act aggressively, with cases of kidnapping and murders of suppliers and even political members of the state of Magadan,it was now reported that werbell forces had kidnapped the mayor of the city of Magadan,demanding the distance of the radical military from the city, something that hinders Werbell's arms business mainly due to his dislike for Yazov,the government already had information about secret American financing for mercenaries,and knew of their capacity and aggressiveness when they already tried to carry out a coup d'état in Magadan in the mid-1960s,A decision must be made as to who can be sent from Moscow to resolve the situation of his kidnapping, which could lead to a serious conflict, either military or diplomatic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
ggg_intro = Mitsubishi's car empire reached the highlands of Koshu,in the face of the internal intensity of post-GAW guangdong,the then car company and political party Mitsubishi rose to its political position,being known as broad experts in capitalism and corporate commerce,Ever since Tomio Kubo was selected to be the head of state of Guangdong, the Mitsubishi brand logo has filled the business signs of metropolitan cities,Kubo proved to be a two-faced man,with one being how it acts towards the state's economy, while the other is how it acts towards the military conflicts of the supporters of the Yunnan National Protection Army,that are being moved in the face of the influence of the army after the GAW,beyond the uncertainties about the utopian ideal of Guangdong, teaching and demonstrating since its creation as a state that sought the futuristic utopia of a rich and developed state,but that under the covers, hid the great social and monetary division, since for them, the northernmost regions of the country were not so interesting to develop,Mitsubishi's political party reigns over the East, Koshu, Guangdong and the former Macau,but it continues to be disputed by other former supporters,Even with Mitsubishi's ancient genius, Guangdong's politics are still divided and conflicting,with even the involvement of neo-socialists that emerged to end the social segregation caused by Mitsubishi's capitalist ambitions,Despite the company party knowing what it does, it must still be careful in this game of political maneuvers and monetary decisions about cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
china_intro = in a glorious way, China remains firm, even after GAW,with the national protection army being defeated, the decisions taken on the peace agreement and the redefinition of the borders of Yunnan and Ghizou,The decision was made to unite all Chinese provinces, except Guangxi and Guangdong,united and establishing a single republic of china,However, even with the army being defeated, Yun had fled to Xinjiang,and even with its lack of presence in the provinces formerly known as "xinan",their peers and remnants continue to cause trouble in the cities of the region,with the Chinese government taking provisional measures typical of martial law,the capital of Yunnan continues to be searched to contain any new emergence of the Long Yun regime,but this is not only present in his former supporters, but also the civil and agrarian population showing greater discontent, as they saw that even after years,the Chinese were still capable of causing a large-scale rebellion,With that, the "China you deserve" plan was launched,a political strategy of teaching and propaganda that aims to convince the population of the region to believe that the victorious Chinese are better and if Long Yun won, they would live in an aggressive totalitarian regime,with the use of deep caetezas and televisions, with cinematic propaganda that shows people jumping, shiny cities and everything else,and this is not only being applied in Xinan, it is also being spread throughout China,something they admitted was Machiavellian, but they would do everything to not see the flag of the national protection army again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
russia_intro = It had been a long time since Russia had fallen,the foolishness Times when Russia wanted to unite again only made us even more violent,Karbishev, the first leader of the Omsk Negro League,with eyes and mind filled with hate and revenge, there had been a prophecy,the great Trial,Karbishev before he died, swore on his soul and on his Russia that one day, Germany would pay,And with Omsk in the hands of the great and fearless Yazov,Russia can unite again under a single goal, revenge, revenge!, REVENGE!!!,The prophecy was getting closer and closer, the army was getting ready, the tanks were turned on and the fighter planes were getting ready to take off,until the day came, uniting anger and the will of karma,the black army crossed eastern Europe, the German generals described them as unstoppable,until the moment arrived where after much retreat, the front had been frozen in front of the crossing of the Diniepre River,Our plans were to get to Berlin,but, things were not as expected,the Burgundian SS had also entered the game,And they were the ones who arrived in Berlin,the Germans were defeated and humiliated,but the presence of Burgundy as our neighbor disturbs our sense of hatred,an idea of invading them was even proposed, but it was rejected because of the risk of general destruction, as both Russia and Burgundy had nuclear arsenals,and destroying the world was not in our plans,now, together with our influence over Eastern Europe,Years passed to focus on rebuilding Russia and imposing the leadership of the new generations...NO GERMANS!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
rus_ev1 = The launch of the Chimera-1 atomic bomb was a success for the means of destruction,it had been launched in Germany, even before Burgundy had taken over,Well.....now that Germany was not under our control, the damage caused is not our problem,since Omsk had been occupied and declared a Siberian Black League,nuclear ideals have always been the pillars for the great trial,yazov knew that these bombs could not fall into the wrong hands,a few years ago, in mid-1965-66,Omsk had already taken over the entire Ural region, defeating Tyumen, Zlatoust, Sverdlovsk and others,It was there that the nuclear manufacturing process began,amid the military factories of Tyumen,Yazov walked around, watching the warheads being assembled like puzzles,he was thoughtful, according to lazarenko,until one day, Yazov began to question his attitudes and ideologies,causing his generals to enter into debates about what was the right thing to do,                                                                          Lazarenko:"Mr. Yazov was walking in the middle of the military factory, I noticed that he was thoughtful,Lately he...has been acting strange?".                                           drozdov: = As far as I know, no, but I don't doubt that he questions the prophecy,Furthermore, how far would a man go to achieve his goal?".                                  Lazarenko: = We will kill innocents, I know, but we are a military nation, and we want the Germans to pay for what they did, at every moment we spill blood, good or bad,I don't know very well if Yazov is religious, but perhaps we can think about the possibility of him being in a church confessional after launching the missiles"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
ita_ev1 = Modern Art Week, an event that became a national political symbol, created by nationalist artists like us, coming from the great nation called Brazil,Many artists believe that without art, there is no life, and this week is dedicated to that,The Regions Of the largest Italian cities commonly known for being organized events,It was bright, people looked out the window and seemed to be seeing a futuristic painting,Since the rise of today's art movement,the concept of nation has been changing,The nation is an art, its flag is an art, its anthem is an art and its history is also an art,deepened by the esoteric artistic mentality, Scaligero always said the answers in an interpretative way,He was considered "the elder",many of his followers wanted to know about his teachings,However, it seemed that as the years passed, Scaligero deteriorated due to age and perhaps madness?this opened up questions about his succession,he always used to paint, even when he became the highest political figure in Italy,and as time went by, his paintings became more abstract, something that was sometimes admired,and was sometimes asked, "How many times has it been demonstrated that an artist's mental deterioration is demonstrated by his paintings,with them being more abstract, meaningless, non-organic,Was this something he intended?" his closest followers wondered,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
bur_ev1 = since the takeover of northern France by Burgundy,the SS police force has become even more aggressive,with measures that were compared to martial law,even the smallest police officers put pressure on those around them,one of the mentalities applied by the SS police was that when rebels and rioters were caught, there was no such thing as "arresting",shoot them, don't leave one alive, otherwise he might come back even bigger,Many of the residents of the less metropolitan regions of Burgundy always saw this scenario,A group of people, about 5-6 or so,lined up facing a wall, and in front, SS men armed to the teeth ready to pull the trigger,They loved to do this in public prayer, to demonstrate what would happen if you said a "but" to Burgundy,This is less common in the Metropolis, they preferred to carry out executions more discreetly,because they didn't want to dirty and fill their biggest cities with bodies, blood and bullets,but the presence of his prey was inevitable,Many times, those who expressed their displeasure against the government disappeared the next day without leaving a trace, there were times when they disappeared the same day they expressed their displeasure,to give you an idea, the disappearance rate in Burgundy is not even calculated, because how would they know if the disappearance of someone is a government silencing or an actual civilian-to-civilian kidnapping,therefore, those cities that had high hypothetical disappearance rates were called "silent city", because the citizens' fear made them stay silent, just so as not to say anything that would displease the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
danu_ev1 = the hitherto known "United League of the Danube",a Burgundian puppet nation created after the fall of Germany, was a strategic preparation for a more open state,among all the nations within the Burgundian influence,the league was considered the least dangerous for tourists,because, on purpose, they were more receptive and less censorious,a strategy for economic revenue from tourism,many reporters, journalists, historians went there to document this nation that fascinated them,a receptive Burgundian nation,it was even a joke among Americans,the nation was an attempt to demonstrate the culture and wealth coming from the Burgundian administration,they wanted to show the world what it was like to be a pure nation,obviously all the tourists were foreigners accepted by the Burgundian tourism regulations, they did not allow entry to people who were on the list of "non-pure races",When his ethnicity and race were questionable, he was taken for physical examinations to define, and if he was part of it, he would simply have his request denied,journalists even joke about it,they called the nation "the holy Burgundy",and for tourists, those allowed of course, they called it "the dust paradise",for it was a rich nation, arising from the ruins of a fallen and dead nation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
burgundy_intro = The Burgundian State of Order, born amid Himmler's relentless pride,Shaped and made under the esotericism and darkness of the black sun,Himmler has always been the most esoteric and radical Nazi in all of Germany,And now with his earthen palace they call Burgundy, he realizes the esoteric utopia of ethnic cleansing,but he wants more, to clean not only what he has, but what is around him,with that, he adopted the expansionist mentality, never missing the opportunity to gain territories and puppets,France was the first to succumb to its objective, invaded in the midst of the German civil war,Then, in 1971, the Russians from Omsk commanded by Yazov invade the East Germanic commissars, for eternal revenge,a full plate for Himmler, in 1972 SS troops invade the German border and open another front, even more dangerous,with the outbreak of the commissars, internal riots and separatist revolts, German hegemony breaks once again, succumbing and being divided in two,with Burgundy taking over Holland, and all of western Germany,even reaching Germany, which became a Himmlerist metropolitan, inspired by Stalingrad,at the end of 73, the SS troops with even more numbers disembark in Plymouth,his military titan reached Newcastle and Liverpool, making Butler's aided government flee to the beyond, with the United Kingdom being completely taken over,Now, in 1975, the Burgundian consolidation throughout Western Europe is in a cycle of Himmlerist reconstruction, an esoteric utopia is on its way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.
italy_intro = since the Dissolution of the Triumvirate, a crack in popular confidence in the Italian government had been made,an alliance justly made to keep Italy sovereign and independent, dissolving as a failed plan, just as the division of the Roman Empire was,It is not news that the Italian government controls the media, culture and everything else,but, with its total presence in art, nationalist modernist movements began to emerge,and the most well-known and sovereign was the ""Unione di tutta la penisola",a nationalist artistic movement that wanted the superiority of art over the top of the Italian cultural chain,its leader, Massimo Scaligero, was always a man who did not hide his anti-Semitic mind,valuing the modern and the national, and even using esoteric practices, perhaps inspired by Burgundy,this movement was highly persecuted by the government as were the others,and about the new regime of Carlo Scorza,the movement was understood as a good and last action against the reactionary Italian government,with spies from Burgundy, who secretly supported the movement,a coup d'état was staged,many historians who witnessed the event described it as "an ant holding a pistol",something so small but they got their hands on such lethal weapons, mainly weapons coming from Burgundy,a French exchange of fire was made in the fascist council,and although the movement was small, little by little victory was imminent,with the Italian government dissolving and the modernist nationalists taking power, with their sovereignty being recognized first by Burgundy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

japan_intro = "money doesn't fall from the sky", they were,Since the beginning of the Japanese dream of wealth and profit, something has always been explicit, capitalism,corporations and corporations that profit, sell, spread and pay, all of this being moved to the lungs of Japan,just as they propagated in the 1930s that Latin America was the garden of the United States, for us,they saw Asia as the organs, but just like the human body,if one fails, the others fail too,a nation-by-nation domino-style fall would leave Japan as the last piece,Japan's growing dependence on agricultural and industrial nations has gone from being a privilege to a problem,today, the year turned to 1975,and so far we have lost the Philippines and Indonesia,great nations that were our farm,the sudden change of things will leave no doubt about any revolts in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia,with the new administration of Ohga, an infamous capitalist, typical of satires,knowing money better than family,was appointed after entering the political game using his fame and knowledge out there,handpicked by the council because he was someone who appeared to know about money,was being won over by the public with his charisma,and in front of his capitalist mind that dreamed of piles of money, he said this when they questioned him about the profit mentality, "money doesn't fall from the sky"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.
usa_intro = the political chess games before Nixon's impeachment were all overturned by the American failure over Africa,and once again, American soldiers return home with their heads down,defeated by "afrika schild",but since they returned home in 1945,has always been said as an OFN motto,do not lose hope, bring democracy and freedom back for the greatest and most remaining chance of liberation,despite having been defeated several times, since 1962, the OFN has increased,with the entry of Brazil, Cuba,Indonesia, Philippines and Iran,results from the bloodshed of Americans, who left their confectionery to fight on the other side of the world,Robert F. Kennedy, JFK's brother,had already said in an interview,that the OFN is like a lifeguard in front of a sea of lava, all he can do is swim from above and observe, but, if a miracle happens and a hand from the lava reaches out to ask for help, he pulls it to the boat,he wasn't wrong,the OFN has always acted quietly,but when an opportunity opened up, he didn't miss it,It's been a while since the last riot,and soon, plans to return to Africa will be made, the great African Reich is great, but it will not last long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

w.ost.cw = While much of the German sphere has always been shrouded by the German government, Ostland never had this issue with multiple international news stations in Riga always ready to be paraded around by German officials to show off the high quality of life, strength of the workforce and happiness of the people in their 'model colony'.                                                                                       Whilst the administration in Ostland have now attempted to close down the various sections of Riga dedicated to the press, guerrilla reporters have still managed to disperse to film the developments on the ground to the world outside. The footage is shocking, showing brutal house to house fighting between various members of the garrison, militia groups, citizenry, and partisans. The international community is still deciding what to make of this footage, and who, if anyone, they are supposed to root for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

bri.cw.txt = It seems yet another domino has fallen in the collapse of the Reich's great Empire, as Britain falls again into chaos. Resistance cells have risen up all across Britain, pledging loyalty to the exile government and the promise of a free, independent Britain, led by 'the Boss', revealed as Sir Maxwell Knight, formally head of MI5, and supposed personal assassin of Domvile.                                                                                     The Collaborator Government on the other hand appears divided, led by an Interim government under Ronald Nall-Cain. Though the Resistance does seem to have the initial advantage, with public support and momentum on their side, both the German Garrison and British army still pledge loyalty to the Government. But will these resources be enough to keep Britannia chained to the Reich, or will Britain be free once more?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

wif6_tx = In the aftermath of negotiations following the Jamaican exit from the West Indies Federation, the Trinidadian state has decided to follow in Jamaica's footsteps and has since declared independence from the very same Federation. After Eric Williams' proposal to dissolve the Federation in favour for a unitary, Trinidad led state had seemingly fallen through with the other member states, it was decided that the only suitable course of action was to exit the Federation altogether.                                                                                     Whilst the decision was made to preserve Trinidad's economic and political integrity, Williams had reaffirmed that trading with the OFN will not cease and has also gone on to ensure OFN commitments are met. Despite reassurements of Grantley Adams, the writing on the wall seems hard to ignore for many Caribbeans...                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

evnews_wif1 = Shockwaves rippled across the international community as news of Jamaica voting to leave the West Indies Federation was announced. Despite opposition from Prime Minister Manley and substantial lobbying from the United States, it was not enough to sway the people into remaining in the Federation. Despite this defeat, the Prime Minister has vowed to abide by the will of the people.                                                                                     Alexander Bustamante of the Jamaican Labor Party, and primary proponent of the referendum, has hailed this as a great victory for the Jamaican people, stating that "Only we will determine our destiny!"                                                                                     Analysts question the future of the Federation, as Jamaica was the primary economy of the bloc, and consider it an ominous sign that the influence of the United States has been shown to be far weaker than expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

jap.inv.1.t = Murder in the Metropolis
jap.inv.1 = The detective got the call late at night about a murder by the docks. It could have been the usual, a deal gone bad over some Manchurian Poppy, some 'chankoro' killed for bad blood, He'd seen the likes. But this was different. The report read like a guide for the perfect murder. No prints, no discernable weapon, no signs of forced entry. Just a corpse mixed in with 2 tons of tuna.                                                                                     Finally, he arrived at the warehouse and crawled underneath the police lines. Whoever did this had a strong stomach, cutting his face up like that, he mused. Unrecognizable. The detective leaned down next to him, getting a closer look at his face. Teeth pulled, fingers taken, and a big 'Chinmoku' carved into his chest. 'Silence'. Who the hell are you?                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.ev4.t = Scouring the Sea
jap.ev4 = Sun and sea warmed the Hiraumi, as it sailed through the Sea of Japan, in search of the creatures of the sea. For Captain Hata and his humble crew of ten, the day had provided good fortune. They were somewhere off the coast of Manchukuo, out of the way of the crowded seas, from the competition. Here, the water was clear of others, and the Hiraumi was free to fish wherever they pleased. The tuna and bonito kept coming, and all knew that they would dine well.                                                                                     Sunset arrived, and the crates were packed with ice and fish. Making preparations to sail back home, Captain Hata saw a shadow of a boat in the distance, with what looked like a man holding a net. Holding binoculars to his eyes, he could easily see it - it was another fisherman, probably a Russian. His eyes slightly hurt - he was looking directly into the setting sun, after all.                                                                                     Compared to the relatively clean appearance of the fisherman, as well as the good shape the Hiraumi was in, the Russian was... poor. His ship was clearly falling apart, in spite of his best efforts. His facial expression was grim, as he pulled out his net from the ocean. Fortune was clearly not on his side; no shine of fish scales could be seen. And the fisherman himself was not in the best condition. Aged far beyond his years, and toughened far more than he should have been. Captain Hata could only watch on with pity, powerless to do anything to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

jap.ev5.t = In the Terraced Mountains
jap.ev5 = Like a hammer hitting hot iron, the rain pounded upon the quaint town of Sa Pa. The soldiers of the fireteam stayed inside the villa, warming themselves by the stove. Outside, fog and rain obscured their view of the rice terraces. Only a faint green tinge reminded the soldiers that they were there. They sipped hot tea, steeped with leaves from the nearby fields. For such cheap tea, it was rather strong, and warmed their souls as the weather stole heat.                                                                                     A loud knock on the door turned their attention away from the conversation. The leader, Hayato, stood up and opened the door. Standing on the porch, clutching a parasol and attempting to carry what seemed to be a heavy tray covered in cloth, was a shivering girl. Couldn't have been more than 10, he surmised. Hayato raised his eyebrows, letting the girl in. She was emotionless, any sympathy not revealing itself. Hayato took the tray from her; she was struggling to carry it and the girl sighed in relief. He lifted the cloth, checking to make sure it was not explosives.                                                                                     On the tray was an assortment of wheel-shaped pastries. They reminded Hayato of Chinese mooncakes, albeit without the elaborate designs stamped on time. He brought it over to the men, who were delighted to have some snacks. Cutting the cakes in eighths, the cakes went well with the tea. The flavors of durian, of mung bean paste, and sometimes even salty egg yolk somehow melded together with the drink. Hayato greatly enjoyed them, and he turned to thank the girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

jap.ev6 = Rejoice and cheer carried through the streets of the Empire of Japan in celebration of the birthday of Emperor Shōwa. His Imperial Majesty's new year of life is commemorated by all from Taiwan to Hokkaidō in a festival honoring the age of peace, fraternity, and cooperation Japan and its Asian brothers now live in.                                                                                     During the reign of Emperor Shōwa, the empire had grown in strength and in size to international superpower-status; now, no one dares challenge Japan like they did before the rule of His Imperial Majesty. It was under His rule that the empire had won against imperialism in the Greater East Asia War, and under His rule that the mighty Co-Prosperity Sphere was founded to preserve this sacred peace. Millions gather to observe the holiday in public or at home to wish good health upon the Emperor, so that his prosperous and just rule may continue long into the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

jap.ev.revi.t = Those Who Control the Present...
jap.ev.revi = Looking at her clipboard, Yoshike scanned the list of names, looking for students that hadn't read from the textbook. Her eyes landed upon Kojima Keitaro. Turning to his direction, she asked, "Keitaro-chan, could you please read for the class?" He silently nodded, turning to his book. Seemingly having forgotten what paragraph he was to read, he slightly panicked. The class grew a little louder, as whispers between friends began to start. Seeing his dilemma, she saved him: "The greedy Chiang government..." she loudly whispered.                                                                                     Thanking Yoshike, he began to read. "The greedy Chiang government in China, in a bid to distract the people of China from their poor lives, staged an incident along the Lugou Bridge in order to start a war. We responded..." Keitaro squinted his eyes. "...appropriately. The Chiang government and the Communists had been fighting with each other, which destroyed China, but they came together to attempt to hold..." Keitaro stopped, and Yoshike intervened to save him again.

After a long war, Pan-Asian Unity had prevailed, and the Chinese people were happy." Keitaro slumped back in his seat, having played his part.                                                                                     "Thank you, Keitaro. Now..." Yoshike picked up a stack of papers, "... You will be doing an activity that will focus on the paragraphs we have just read."                                                                                     "Yoshike-sensei, will we be learning more about this later?" One of her students, Sayo, inquired.

Yoshike passed out the worksheets, as her pupils began to write as soon as they received the papers.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.1.t = General Sun Dianying Is Arrested
jap.dl.1 = Sun Dianying was relieved after Jessfield 76 had let him go some days prior. He made a note to himself to stay out of the way of secret police in the future, especially now that he would soon be retiring. Still, he had been released and relieved of the burden of their suspicions, at least in an official capacity. It was not as if further interrogations would yield anything more, they had nothing on him and it would continue that way. As he sat by the window, smoking a cheap cigarette, he wondered if any of his colleagues would also be interrogated. Still, the matter was over for him and thus not worth troubling himself too much with.                                                                                     It therefore came as a great surprise to General Sun, after opening the door to his apartment, to be greeted by the sight of three officers of the Kenpeitai and a particularly nervous translator. Without as much as a feigned gesture of respect for military rank, he was grabbed and handcuffed by two of the Kenpeitai agents, while the third read off a number of charges they had brought against him.                                                                                     Old General Sun Dianying was hurriedly shoved into the back of a featureless truck, while the Chinese translator did his best to relay the news to him. While Sun was sure they had nothing on him, just like with Jessfield 76, he couldn't help but feel like he would be taken in for rather longer this time.                                                                                     It didn't take long for the Chinese authorities to notice Sun's arrest and disappearance into the bowels of the Kenpeitai's local department. Most troubling though, was the lack of any explanation for the actions of the Japanese agents, who had simply descended upon the old General's quiet apartment complex, without as much as a phone call to any authority in China. A demand for transparency was in order, and it would be coming straight from the General Staff of the ROC. To see their colleague treated in such a manner was a striking insult and regardless of what overruling authority the Kenpeitai might have within the Sphere, they had a dangerous line which could not go.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.1.a = Why didn't they alert anyone?

jap.dl.2.t = ROC General Staff Demands Explanation
jap.dl.2 = Not wishing to waste any more time, while the Kenpeitai continued to violate not only a significant number of laws and treaties but also the dignity of the Chinese army, the ROC General Staff gathered in the early morning to force the issue to a swift conclusion.                                                                                     As they sat around an office made hazy by a mixture of cigarette smoke after some hours of discussion, it was decided that a telegram would be sent straight to the very top, to the Prime Minister of Japan. The General Staff would demand an answer to two questions relating to General Sun's capture. Firstly, why had the Kenpeitai decided to overrule the thorough and sound interrogation conducted by Jessfield 76? Secondly, why had they decided to abduct the General without as much as a word to the proper authorities, most importantly the ROC General Staff itself? The telegram concluded with a request that should any wrongdoing be discovered, that the generals be allowed to deal with it.                                                                                     The message was then quickly dispatched after being marked as distinctly urgent. Most of the General staff elected to wait for a response, rather than retire to bed and risk finding that the situation had grown ever more appalling. When a reply from the Prime Minister did not arrive after several hours, the General Staff were left with two possibilities as to what was occuring in Tokyo. Either the Japanese were still floundering for an appropriate answer to send back to them, or that the Prime Minister had simply decided to ignore their demands outright.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.2.a = This is troubling.

jap.dl.3.t = China Demands an Explanation
jap.dl.3 = The telegram sent by the General Staff of the ROC arrived at the Kotei just in time for the Prime Minister's breakfast. After passing through a number of security checks, the telegram itself was delivered alongside the usual selection plates, cups and other crockery. As the Prime Minister read through the message between sips of green tea, a look of frank confusion, followed by severe concern spread across his face.                                                                                     He had of course heard of General Sun's previous arrest and subsqeuent unfruitful interrogation by Jessfield 76, leading him to believe that the man would fade away into retirement. Therefore, this news of his sudden, and most of all mysterious second arrest by the Kenpeitai was nothing short of extremely troubling. The matter was now worsened by the fact that the ROC General Staff were demanding answers and actions on the Prime Minister's part, and they had seemingly been aware of the issue before even himself.                                                                                     Breakfast ended rather quicker than usual, as the Prime Minister rushed off to contact the Home Minister. As he had no explanation as to the matter either, he demanded that it be investigated immediately. In the meantime, he would send off some vague promise of a forthcoming documentation of Sun's arrest. As the rush-job of a reply was sent back to Nanjing, the Prime Minister was left with the thought that the answer the Chinese General Staff was seeking would be far more complex than anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.3.a = If we knew anything, we'd tell you already.

jap.dl.4.t = The Home Minister's Initial Report
jap.dl.4 = With the Prime Minister attempting to keep the ROC General Staff distracted with promises of a soon to be delivered explanation of General Sun's arrest, it was now up to the Home Minister to formalise a report that would hopefully rectify the increasingly concerning matter.                                                                                     After some dubious reluctance on the part of the Kenpeitai stationed in Nanjing, the Home Minister was finally able to acquire a copy of their report. The initial sections of the documents explained that Sun had been arrested following the Kenpeitai's dissatisfaction with the previous efforts of Jessfield 76. Following paragraphs detailed the pressing urgency of acquiring proper information from the old General, with fears that the wider issues being examined by the Kenpeitai might grow out of control. The Home Minister found himself more confused than ever, yet there were still more documents to examine.                                                                                     Sun, as it turned out, was only a small part of something much larger in scale. While the Japanese secret service had naturally dedicated much of their time to eradicating any traces of potential Chinese resistance from the ROC, they had in recent months began to focus on potential infiltration of the Japanese army. Sun's arrest was an attempt to find a link between the resistance and any Japanese officers that might have become compromised in some capacity.                                                                                     With this revelation now in the hands of the Home Minister, he opted to immediately deliver his report to the Prime Minister in person. As expected, the Prime Minister was deeply concerned with the developments. There was little solace to be had in knowing that the situation in China might be truly disastrous. The Prime Minister could only hope that the Kenpeitai prove more forthcoming with their information in the future. As the Home Minister exited his office, he could only stare at the document presented before him, hoping that the characters on the paper might materialise into a solution.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.4.a = Troubling, to say the least.

jap.dl.5.t = From the Valley of the Dead
jap.dl.5 = The sun was fading. The shadows got longer and longer, until beams shining through the windows created silhouettes in the ground that were outlandishly high, like beasts in a shadow puppet show. The Prime Minister was tapping his foot on the ground anxiously. He had to get the call. For what must have been the fourth time in that hour, he checked the lines. They were not cut or bugged. The lines were secure, but no amount of reassurance would convince him so. The room was too dark. He did not like to see his own shadow. It loomed over him, followed him. It would never leave. He despised it for that.                                                                                     Pulling the cord on the lamp, he read through the papers again, his hands shaking as he pulled them to the light of the lamp. From Nanjing, the Kenpeitai. All connected to the end of the war with China. The final moments. He remembered those days, how it all seemed so clear. These papers offered a glimpse at those times, when peace in all the world was certain. And that grim photo, sitting atop the neat stack of papers. The body was unrecognizable, crushed by Chongqing rumble and burned to a cinder.                                                                                     All of the evidence was coming together in the most terrifying way. It made the Prime Minister sick to his stomach.                                                                                     The telephone rang. The Prime Minister hesitated for a moment. His heart was beating faster than it had ever rung before, faster then when the bombs hit the enterprise or when the Germans blew up Pearl Harbor.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.5.a = Suddenly, his gut made the choice for him, and his hands shot for the telephone.

jap.dl.6.t = A Great Conspiracy
jap.dl.6 = As Kenpeitai reports made their way to Tokyo, it was becoming clear to the Home Minister just how truly bad the Chinese infiltration had become. Older reports had little actual basis in their claims of mass infiltration of the Japanese army. They spoke little of Dai Li either, instead presenting a number of theories as to which Chinese rebels were believed to still be alive and capable of directing such a plot against the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yet as more and more information arrived at the Home Minister's office, mere rumours and dubious theories began to transform into genuine facts.                                                                                     The name Dai Li began to appear in more and more reports, and as it did, so did the names of many Japanese officers. Some were believed to have willingly joined with Dai Li's cause, fully aware of their betrayal. Others were seemingly unaware of their crimes, having been misled by the multitude of agents that the Chinese had spread throughout the Sphere. With each moment, with each paper that was read, with each telegram from the Nanjing Kenpeitai, a conspiracy was being unveiled.                                                                                     As the Home Minister discovered more and more about the seemingly bottomless conspiracy, the circle of those he dared to share his findings with continued to shrink. He had already begun locking away any document pertaining to Dai Li when he left his office for even a moment. He had dismissed his usual assistants too, preferring to copy each file by himself. Another safe, if tedious measure. For now, he would continue to report to the Prime Minister and only ever in person. If anyone else was to hear of Dai Li, it would be on Kantei's authority.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.6.a = Oh no.

jap.dl.7.t = The Army Minister's Proposal"l
jap.dl.7 = The Prime Minister was not exactly sure what he was expecting and his army minister also did not seem to know with certainty what exactly he should expect. They sat down in the cabinet and for a few minutes they were completely silent. He could expect anything - outright orders, suggestions of resignation, very forceful demands of explanations or immediate concessions. Instead, the army minister heavily sighed, as he seemed to be struck as heavily by this news as him.                                                                                     "I thought I could trust them, you know?" he said. "I really thought so."                                                                                     The Prime Minister silently nodded. The General stirred up his tea, not looking the Prime Minister directly into his eyes.                                                                                     "I just wonder how we got here. I don't actually think Dai Li is important," he said. "What is important is that the army is no longer the paragon of virtue. The men in high ranks, working with such war criminals and enemies of the Empire? Madness, pure madness. But it's all true."                                                                                     The leader of Japan's civilian government sighed.                                                                                     "We shall conduct an investigation immediately to find out the traitors and deliver justice." He promised.                                                                                     "Yes, I know," the army minister sighed. "You know how this works. Those are my conditions."                                                                                     Half an hour later they were already set in place. The investigation was supposed to be swift, decisive, conclude swiftly and in limited scale. The army demanded "some sort of ability" to influence the investigation, although the details would be discussed later. The army minister also asked for the Prime Minister to inform him regularly of progress. Although the conditions were downright insulting for the elected Prime Minister of Japan, he felt down in his heart that there is not much choice.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.7.a = We are in no position to deny.

jap.dl.8.t = Picking a Chief Investigator
jap.dl.8 = Once plans for the investigation were brought out to the military, their reaction was predictable. Many forceful letters and telegrams were sent out to the Prime Minister, before the two sides came to the negotiating table.                                                                                     Mutō Akira was a long standing militarist, and his reputation was notorious among the Japanese government for his connections to conspiracies and coups in the interwar years. Now he entered the Prime Minister's office, accompanied by half a dozen other army and navy officers, to settle the matter of the investigation.                                                                                     "You do understand that we will be more than willing to supervise the investigations." said Mutō bluntly, his finger rapping on the hardwood chair he sat in across from the Prime Minister.                                                                                     "I do understand," he replied, "but this is a matter of criminal investigation. Many of my associates are suggesting the Home Ministry lead the case. To have military supervisors in an investigation over the Imperial Army in China would likely leave many stones unturned."                                                                                     General Mutō winced - even in his old age he was prone to bouts of anger, but he could not risk humiliating himself in front of the Prime Minister. He insisted once again that leaving the Home Ministry in charge would be nothing but a bureaucratic mess, and only hand more power "to the meddlesome representatives in Tokyo".                                                                                     "Your Excellency, the army can acquire the records and suspects faster than it will take the Home Ministry. This is an incident outside of Japan, and it should fall under our administration, not Tokyo's."                                                                                     It seems that a choice will need to be made as to who is the full authority on this investigation. More likely than not, someone close is going to be very unhappy.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.8.a = The Home Ministry would be best.
jap.dl.8.b = A military edge is what we need.

jap.dl.9.t = The Great Conspiracy Unfolds
jap.dl.9 = "So," the Kenpeitai officer said to Masahiro, "what did you see in the forests, Lieutenant Masahiro? The HQ would be incredibly interested in the details of such." They sat in gray concrete room, with a single electric bulb alighting their conversation. Masahiro could not hear what was going on outside. The Kenpeitai had requested that he come to their office for questioning. That was the scare of his day, words that chilled his soul. Now that he was in the station, he was in the hands of the military police.                                                                                     "Well," Masahiro began, "the villagers have sighted a figure walking through the bamboo forests, wearing a cloak made out of long leaves." He rustled his hands against one another. "They say that it is a spirit of vengeance. You know, like a Chinese version of yōkai. I did not believe them, either. I don't take many walks out there in the woods - but the reports kept coming in. Soon, my office was full of villagers outright gossiping that a spirit of vengeance is coming for us all."                                                                                     The Kenpeitai officer looked at Masahiro, noting everything that he said. "Do you believe it, Masahiro-san? Personally?"                                                                                     "No, I don't. As I said, I don't take many walks out there in the woods. However, when I do, there is a certain chill that runs through me." He looked down at his fingers. "Like someone was watching me."                                                                                     "Hmm." The Kenpeitai officer coughed. "That will be all. Thank you, Lieutenant Masahiro."                                                                                     "Just one question." The officer looked at him intently.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.9.a = "How will you go about ghost-busting?"

jap.dl.10.t = Dai Li - Mastermind Behind Everything
jap.dl.10 = For thousands of Japanese troops the name of the mysterious individual responsible for their suffering and death was not known. Many Chinese patriots died to assassins employed by him, not realising the mastermind behind it.                                                                                     After the Northern Expedition, to the Japanese, Dai Li was just one of many almost anonymous officials. The true nature of the monster was revealed only later. Thousands dead, loyal allies gone, and every carefully planned offensive hit by the leaks - all possible thanks to spymaster of the accursed Chiang Kai-shek.                                                                                     In the aftermath of the Battle of Chongqing the infamous 'Ghost of Chongqing' was believed to be dead. Now, when he is revealed, many questions of old return with even more tremendous force. Who is this man? What does he believe? What are his goals? Who are people that follow him?                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.10.a = Questions pile up, and they must be answered.

jap.dl.11.t = How to Cheat Death?
jap.dl.11 = The investigators were stupefied at the task ahead of them. Dai Li was alive, and planning resistance in China. And the only reason anyone was aware of this was a policeman noticed that the charred corpse was too short. Who knows what other information must have been passed over? The most powerful men in Japan wanted answers now, and so the vetted agents went to work.                                                                                     Day and night investigators pored through every footnote they had on his organization. During 1944, there were at least 100,000 other Juntong agents throughout China, and probably twice as many military or political men who could have followed the man out of Chongqing. A network of that many people would need to be whittled down if any evidence was to lead to more than a hunt for a senile ex-spy. Decrypted lists from the war detailed hundreds of NRA cells and caches. Fortunately for the archivists, there was plenty of records from the IJA of which holdouts had been found and eliminated.                                                                                     After days of searching, it became clear that Dai Li had plenty of ways to get out of Chongqing, and with other anti-Japanese leaders declared missing.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.11.a = A truly cunning and worthy opponent indeed.

jap.dl.12.t = Chongqing: Where Everything Started
jap.dl.12 = The Battle of Chongqing ended in 1947, and as the last battle of the Second World War, both sides were equally devastated. Due to starvation and general dissent, most of the proper army of Chiang Kai-Shek collapsed into disorganized militias. One of those militias was the infamous Loyal Patriotic Army led by Dai Li. Despite massive shortages, Dai Li's leadership and fanaticism inspired his men to ferociously resist the Japanese.                                                                                     In the ruins of Chongqing, the supposedly dead body of Dai Li was found, and with LPA units limiting their activity, it was thought that total victory was finally won. Now that we know that Dai Li cheated death, we cannot be certain anymore. There are two major questions. Did LPA survive the aftermath of the Chongqing battle, and if so, are they still related to the great conspiracy set by Dai Li?                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.12.a = Let's examine the aftermath of the Battle of Chongqing.

jap.dl.13.t = Remains of the Loyal Patriotic Army
jap.dl.13 = Takeichi Takamura's office swelters in the humid Sichuan weather, punctuated with the distinct smell of Chunghwas and a smattering of both Japanese and Chinese among his clerks. Chengdu was nearing the far ends of Tokyo's grasp over China, and while it may not be an active warzone like Mengjiang was, it was a pretty dead-end posting for a career bureaucrat.                                                                                     That is, until the reports by panicking locals started flooding.                                                                                     It started with an upsurge of watchman weapon requisitions. Sure, a few surplus rifles and sidearms - who cares what goes missing in the labyrinth of Japanese-controlled China anyway? Then, bit by bit, the weapons started to disappear. And then, the declarations and warnings started.                                                                                     Takamura was called to investigate an attack on a depot far to the north. Reading through the details of the attack, he felt his blood freeze.                                                                                     "This is for Chongqing"                                                                                     There aren't that many organised resistance forces in the region that's capable of such an attack, and the telltale signs were all there. Surely this can't be it, uttered Takamura - we got rid of the LPA ages ago!                                                                                     "Call Sato for a private meeting - I think we may be onto something huge here."                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.13.a = Irrelevant. Focus on Juntong core.
jap.dl.13.b = Launch investigation into Dai Li's militia force.

#A

jap.dl.14.t = Loyal Until the End
jap.dl.14a = The Sichuan humidity was tempered by a misty morning drizzle, as raindrops tap on the window in Takeichi Takamura's office. What was usually a cool respite for the liaisons officer turned into an immense distraction to his work on the investigation. Opposite him was Masaharu Satō, jovially whistling the melody of a Shanghai bar room singer playing on the turntable.                                                                                     "Cut it out, Sato - I'm working here."                                                                                     "Well, where the hell are you even gonna start? There's twenty new groups calling themselves resistance fighters every month, only to reveal themselves as extortion gangs in their second week."                                                                                     "It's not what you- forget it, just turn down the turntable a little, and pass me that folder."                                                                                     "Noteworthy Groups and Organisations. Interesting little folder for a backwater like this."                                                                                     The folder was, as Sato had mentioned previously, filled with irrelevant and trifling groups. Hell, there were even six groups claiming to be directly loyal to Chiang Kai-Shek himself - ignoring how he's dead, and decidedly so for more than twenty years now. Takamura lights a cigarette and sighs in frustration, until Sato breaks the silence.

Either they're ridiculously lucky, or they're not from Hui in the first place."                                                                                                                                                                          .

The Order of the Auspicious Jade was an ordinary monastic organisation on the surface. Adherents of Mongolian Buddhism, they claim to be refugees from Hui State - an organisation dedicated to forming mutual aid networks through their circle of temples, to alleviate the misery as well as savagery brought upon by Tsuji's administration. Noble on the surface it seems, with little reasons to suspect. At least, until one realises that it's nigh impossible to evade Tsuji's cavalry patrols, roaming around the borders of Hui to ensure nobody escapes.

I heard from one certain Zhang Liren that they don't even speak Mandarin in the northwestern dialect, one of their leaders even sounds like he's from Yunnan."                                                                                     Takamura knows they don't have much time - but who can he rely on for a quick and decisive raid? The police? Poorly equipped rabble who are bathing in a cloud of opium half the time. The Kenpeitai? Who's to say that they're not allied? The only reasonable option left is the army - and he could count on a favor from a certain gambling-addled colonel.

jap.dl.16.t = Round Up in Chengdu Successful
jap.dl.16a = Masaharu Sato stands underneath a street lamp in a seemingly empty road. Taking out a match, he lights one up and wipes it on his boot. He repeats the weird gesture again, twice for posterity. Upon the third match, eight plainclothes agents armed with Arisaka rifles and Nambus emerge from an alley.                                                                                     "Almost thought you forgot the signal. Where's Takamura?"

The nine men walk up to the monastery's compound carefully, while stopping behind a corner to avoid a sentry. The sentry made a fateful turn towards the patrol, as Sato locked him in a chokehold with a knife to his throat.                                                                                     "I know who you are, and I know what you do. If you cooperate, I'll let you live. So answer this question good - is the Order a Juntong unit?"

Two of you - keep him tied here."                                                                                     The attacking detachment split themselves into two units - one from the main entrance, and the rest from a side gate left unlocked by the sentry. The ensuing firefight was a one-sided slaughter, with only one Japanese operative dead. As Sato approached the corpse of the Order's leader, he stumbled upon several dossiers left in an unlocked safe.

Sato lets out a grin - his work here is done.                                                                                                                                                                          .

"I'm sure of it - Northern Chengdu's been a red blip on the army's since two weeks ago," quietly uttered Takamura as he let out another puff from his half-finished cigarette. It seems as though he has finally tracked down the ever-elusive Loyal Patriotic Army - or at least, whatever's left of it. Though this was a shot in the dark, it was the only shot the department had at the moment, and time is ticking away before they can yet again bleed into the countryside.

Takamura and Sato quickly realised that their overstretched police squadrons probably wouldn't be up to task for a job like this and unfortunately, there's only one more authority in the region they could trust to expand this mission with - the army. The pent-up paranoia from interservice rivalry, partisan and 'partisan' attacks understandably have made Takamura incredibly reluctant to cooperate with the army, let alone on such a high-risk mission like this.                                                                                     Unfortunately, only the army has the resources for such an excursion to both conduct the sweep and gather sensitive intelligence from the countryside.

The room fills with cigarette smoke-par for the course for the overworked liaison officers in the tropical hell that is Sichuan. A thin, measly lightbulb shines on the room, leaving faint shadows. Faint shadows exactly like the ones Sato and Takamura were chasing.                                                                                     "I don't either - but the evidence is there.

Heaving to catch his breath, the courier manages to give the officers a salute before handing a folder to Satō. On its cover lay the words "AFTER ACTION REPORT - 30 October 1968." Sato peeled to the next page, eager in anticipation. What greeted him made his heart sink.                                                                                     "Hey, Takamura?

His heart sank to his stomach too when he read its contents, followed by a deep sigh.

Corruption, so easily ignored earlier, now became the threat of national security. The parties, bizarre relationships - none of that was to be ignored anymore. Post-1947 Republic of China administration was purged out of agents, or at least it was believed so. Now with the unholy revelations being unleashed, those events that should ring the alarm, now would.                                                                                     Of course, the Republic of China and its administration is loyal to us, but lone wolves can work in its structure nonetheless. It is therefore very important to immediately conduct full-scale investigation into both civilian administration of the Nanjing government and intelligence service of Jessfield 76, whos chief Ding Mocun, while loyal - proved to be rather incompetent.

jap.dl.18.t = Audit Result: the Juntong Was Decentralized
jap.dl.18 = The group of agents waiting in the room were from two very separate worlds: To the left sat a number of Chinese intelligence officials, working to catch down the last traitors to China's new regime. To the right, the heart of Japan's investigative committee, on a mission to find a once dead terrorist now influencing all of China to revolt. The Japanese investigators were hesitant of their Chinese comrade's findings, but remained eager to see the final results of the audit.                                                                                     The head of the joint Sino-Japanese group entered, holding a pile of papers; the summation of their work in tracking down the Juntong. He distributed copies across the table, and the room was silent, but for the flipping of paper and breathing.                                                                                     Auditing revealed that the Juntong, Dai Li's powerful intelligence agency, is likely not in a direct command structure. Rather, it appears that the Juntong has become decentralized; as small cells dot all of China with little cross communication. A single hunt might bring in just half a dozen agents with no direct superiors. It seems that we will need to find out how exactly these cells coordinate their findings if the 'Ghost of Chongqing' is to be caught and defeated. Any intercepted message must be analyzed thoroughly from now on.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.18.a = But how could he do it with so much surveillance?

jap.dl.19.t = Dai Li's Motive?
jap.dl.19 = For all the research and investigations the committee had done, there was one question that had been put to the side for more pressing matters of finding Dai Li: what was his plan? Why was he still fighting a war decades gone past?                                                                                     The committee vetted much of Japan's top criminal psychologists to help piece together the mind of a terrorist. The investigators were clear though, that even the slightest mention of their existence to the Japanese public would be met with the utmost repercussions on their entire careers at best.                                                                                     Around a conference table in one of many buildings the investigators occupied, the dozen or so men and women who made up Japan's greatest psychologists could only come to a few conclusions. Some said Dai Li was simply driven insane by the war, others suspected he could be planning an attempt to sabotage the army, or even an overthrow of the Chinese government. Other psychologists suggested countless other motives, though these were reasons for a thug to rob a home, not the driving force for a national conspiracy.                                                                                     After some more hours of debate, the conclusive statement is that of a currently unknown motive. As insane or vengeful as any fanatical holdout may be, China is not susceptible to any sort of uprising to turn them against the Japanese Empire. The investigators sigh in frustration. Dai Li's master plan cannot be predicted.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.20.t = Adrift in a Sea of Leads
jap.dl.20 = Despite all the information that the investigator had gathered, something simply was not adding up. He had followed several good leads, tied the evidence together and still wound up at a brick wall. Surely he had just missed some detail? Perhaps he needed to listen to one of the interviews again? There had to be a link somewhere.                                                                                     Across the table, his colleague looked up from his papers. "Why don't you take a break for the day? You've been looking over the same leads for hours now. I doubt you've actually gotten anywhere."

I would appreciate your help."                                                                                     "Well, my advice is that you stop and try something else. You're acting as if you already have the big picture. Perhaps something really is just missing?"                                                                                     The investigator was forced to concede. There were other paths for the investigation to pursue.                                                                                                                                                                          .

#USA investigation

jap.dl.21.t = The Fate of the American Expeditionary Forces
jap.dl.21 = The Sino-American Cooperative Organisation, the American expeditionary force that was deployed during the Second World War, was believed to have been fully evacuated by 1944. With far more pressing matters to take care of, the traces left behind by SACO were quickly investigated and then mostly forgotten. They became little more than a memory from the war that left little behind to concern Japan... or so it was believed.                                                                                     With a link between the Americans and Dai Li having recently been uncovered, the remains of the SACO's presence that littered China became a priority for the investigators. A number of planes were wrecked in close proximity to each other, and this site might prove vital to finding out what truly happened to the americans.                                                                                     At the same time, the security minister has contacted spies in the United States, should they be capable of finding files on the fate of the expeditionary forces. It is suspected that records of who among the Americans returned alive are still kept, and that they are within our reach. At the behest of the Home Minister, it was decided that the investigating officers be given the reigns to choose which route to pursue first.                                                                                     Theories raced through the heads of the investigators as they considered their options. Had Dai Li escaped the war through with the evacuating Americans, only to return a few months ago? Has SACO helped to establish Dai Li's presence in China over twenty years ago? Could it be that the United States were funding Dai Li, using the evacuation in 1944 as a cover for their forces secretly remaining in the region? In truth, the only truth that the investigators could count on so far, was that only by digging deeper would they uncover what they sought.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.21.a = Did all Americans really abandon China?

jap.dl.22.t = SACO's Background
jap.dl.22 = The Sino-American Cooperative Organisation, the American expeditionary force that was deployed during the war, was believed to have been fully evacuated by 1944. With far more pressing matters to take care of, the traces left behind by SACO were quickly investigated and then mostly forgotten. They became little more than a memory from the war that left little behind to concern Japan... or so it was believed.

At the same time, the security minister has contacted spies in the United States, should they be capable of finding files on the fate of the expeditionary forces. It is suspected that records of who among the Americans returned alive are still kept, and that they are within our reach. At the behest of General Iwaichi Fujiwara, it was decided that the investigating officers be given the reigns to choose which route to pursue first.

jap.dl.22.a = Investigate the crash sites again.
jap.dl.22.b = Alert American detachments.

jap.dl.23a.t = Crashsite Laid Bare
jap.dl.23a = The crash sites would be examined first, upon the investigators' suggestion. After all, the American documents were at least being preserved in a drawer somewhere. Their journey from the airport at Nanjing to the mountains of Southwestern China had presented them with a multitude of memorable vistas as they traveled by rail, road and finally, footpath to reach their destination. It was nothing short of deeply refreshing to leave their Tokyo office for more than a day or two.                                                                                     The sites themselves consisted of wrecks of about four downed American aircraft, lost during their attempted evacuation in 1944. In the ensuing twenty years since the initial investigation had closed with little to report other than the obvious, nature had distinctly managed to reclaim much of the wreckage. Nature had also begun to creep back in to one or two sites, with a wing or two sticking out of a field of crops. The site was steadily becoming steadily more disappointing, as the investigators looked on.                                                                                     With the aid of the report from the previous team that had worked on the crashes, the investigators were able to confirm one thing - the previous report was absolutely correct. The planes were some of the last that had attempted to leave China, and had been caught by anti-air guns positioned to stop them. Apart from some battered ration kits, a dog tag and some other personal effigies, the search was fruitless. Worst of all was the lack of anything that led back to Dai Li, or even a hint that perhaps some Americans were still out there.                                                                                     They would need to widen their search, perhaps into Tibet. Had anyone managed to escape the crash, or otherwise survive the evacuation, then they would have quickly tried to move on. The investigators could take solace in one thing alone at this point: at least the scenery would continue to be interesting.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.23a.a = Dig deeper.

jap.dl.24a.t = No Luck
jap.dl.24a = The expanded investigation site demanded a considerably larger staff for the investigators to make use of. Forensic teams, excavating equipment were all requested from the Home Islands. Alongside the additional manpower came a number of small boats, trucks and even a helicopter, in order to better survey the landscape.                                                                                     While the area surrounding the crashed planes were surveyed by the new team, the actual investigators had moved on to Tibet. There, they had hoped to find some evidence of the route taken by SACO after leaving China. Yet, the trail was quickly found to be colder than the mountains the investigators trekked through. Locals confirmed that American soldiers had indeed traveled through their communities, but they had never stayed for long and never left a trace of their presence.                                                                                     The Chinese side of the investigation proved to be equally disappointing. Despite searching the area in what could only be described as a thorough manner, the team found little more than a few scraps of metal from the crashed planes. They had sunk to the bottom of a nearby river and upon their extraction, the scraps unearthed some shards of ancient Chinese pottery. These were jokingly regarded as the real finds of the entire expedition, although the investigators were never allowed in on the joke.                                                                                     After several weeks of searching, only one more object of interest was found. A single plane. It had gone down over the Himalayas, and by examining what little that remained of it, the investigators were able to only achieve one thing. It told them the same, now redundant facts, that they had known since they first read the initial report from twenty years ago.                                                                                                                                                                           .
jap.dl.24a.a = Frustration runs deep.

jap.dl.25a.t = A Waste of Time
jap.dl.25a = The investigators returned to the Tokyo branch office, having obtained nothing of value from the crash sites in China and Tibet. Not once had anything of any relation to Dai Li cropped up, and it therefore seemed as if the connection between him and SACO was a secret kept only by out-of-reach American officials and Dai Li himself. At the very least, the investigators were able to confirm the findings of the initial investigation in the 1940s were most certainly accurate. Yet, this ultimately did little to dampen the impact of their failure. They would be forced to remain in Tokyo for a good while now, whilst the government turned towards its other assets for aid.                                                                                     In the United States, the Japanese government employed a number of spies to provide them with insight as to the workings of the United States government. Since the Dai Li conspiracy had first been uncovered, these figures had been waiting to find out exactly what the Americans might know about the situation. Their time was now soon to come, with Tokyo desperate for answers. Besides, guarded state secrets must surely contain some useful information.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.25a.a = A mission of utmost urgency.

jap.dl.26.t = Gaining Access to Archives
jap.dl.26 = Naturally, anything pertaining to covert military operations in a hostile foreign power would be closely guarded behind safes, locks and guarded doors. The first step to accessing these records was fairly simple. The archive building would be scouted out, day and night. Each entrance would be checked for alarms, guard patrols would be memorized and any potential job opportunity that might get one inside the building would be quickly taken.                                                                                     More and more information was gathered regarding the archives. Photographs were taken of the exterior and surrounding area, at every hour of the day. Eventually, blueprints of the building were discovered, providing the spies with a new level of insight. A plan was beginning to take shape. The next step would involve getting inside the archive for long enough to expand upon their limited insider knowledge. The fastest possible route from one entrance to the SACO files would be plotted and if possible, tested before the actual break-in would take place. These next few steps would be delicately executed, even with pressure from the government back in Japan.                                                                                     Some back in Tokyo had demanded a quicker operation, yet this course of action was ruled out. It was better to not start a diplomatic incident with the United States, while at the same time dealing with a possible conspiracy within the ranks of the army.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.26.a = Just a little more time...

jap.dl.27.t = SACO Records Found!
jap.dl.27 = In the end, it took merely one open door and a faulty electrical system to gain access to the SACO files, for the janitor on duty had been careless enough to leave the back entrance way unlocked after finishing up for the night. Five minutes later, the power went out, and the security guard called for an electrician to resolve the issue. For the brief fifteen minutes, the building was completely dark and security a little laxer as the security guard himself escorted the electrician to the fusebox. Yet that was all it took. At that time, a man in a black coat entered the building and removed exactly one document from the Chinese section of the archives, before leaving and driving off in a rather anonymous van. He would later meet with the janitor and the electrician to celebrate their successful operation.                                                                                     The cargo of that van was then handed off to another agent, waiting at a nearby airfield. After a number of plane and car journeys from the East Coast to the West, and a brief stop in San Francisco, he boarded a boat headed to Hawaii. Waiting there was General Fujiwara himself, who had been anxious to see the documents delivered. Now, they were in his hands, safe on his personal plane en route to Tokyo.                                                                                     It was there that the files were finally opened. Behind closed doors Fujiwara and the Prime Minister, alongside other trusted officials, gathered to hear just what the Americans knew. It was a simple enough thing, a mere list of the fates of the SACO members, listed alphabetically, beginning with those killed. One name of interest cropped up, General Joseph Stilwell, confirmed to have been KIA. The assembled politicians continued to scan the list, with a growing sense of angst and urgency. Just as it seemed they were about to hit another dead end consisting of nothing but RETURNED, more and more Americans were listed as MIA, possibly having been forced to stay behind. Yet one name made the officials pause in their tracks, the name of a rumoured friend of Dai Li.                                                                                     MILES, MILTON E. (ADMIRAL) - MIA: LAST SEEN 3 DAYS PRIOR TO FULL SACO EVACUATION.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .
jap.dl.27.a = Admiral Miles never left China?

jap.dl.28.t = Searching For a Dead Man
jap.dl.28 = The revelation of the SACO documents began to take its grasp over the assembled politicians, leaving them perplexed momentarily. A degree of normalcy then returned to the room, before the Prime Minister dismissed his array of advisors. Just prior to exiting himself, the Home Minister announced that he would be contacting Kenpeitai departments across the Sphere, in the hopes that they might now finally be able to narrow down the search.                                                                                     With the investigators now out in the field again, they were able to make some headway regarding the missing admiral. A courier sent out of Shanghai was found to be carrying a package discreetly marked with the emblem of the Juntong, the intelligence service belonging to Dai Li. Interrogating the courier relieved that he had been paid a hefty sum to take the package from Shanghai to Hangzhou, where he would be again paid upon delivering the parcel to a location just outside the city. The man in question was certainly not the admiral based upon the courier's description, yet it was a solid lead nonetheless.                                                                                     Before proceeding any further with their mission, the agents delivered their report to the Home Minister, detailing the investigator's new hypothesis regarding the admiral's current actions and whereabouts. While they were yet to confirm his exact location, the most obvious spot was now Shanghai. A large, coastal city, with a great deal of foreigners made for a good hideout for an American not looking for attention. General Fujiwara sent the investigators a simple response upon reading their report:                                                                                     "Move in on Shanghai, you will receive reinforcements soon. Surround the city and find Admiral Miles."                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.28.a = One step closer...

jap.dl.29.t = The Admiral's Cover
jap.dl.29 = Shanghai was filled with the agents of the Kenpeitai and Tokkō, from each and every direction. Some took up positions along the roads in and out of the city, while others used disguises in order to infiltrate the recesses of Shanghai's underbelly. They would slowly sink their claws into the city, sealing off each and every escape route with every passing day. If nothing else, the admiral would be quite unable to leave without being seen. An invisible siege had just begun.                                                                                     While the investigating agents continued to widen their net over Shanghai, they turned their focus towards what identity Milton E. Miles might have assumed to blend into his new surroundings. As an American, the admiral would already be limited in his options. He would need to remain in districts home to many foreigners, with the financial district coming to the minds of the investigators first. Miles was likely posing as a merchant, someone recognisable to his allies, but subtle enough to avoid suspicion.                                                                                     Then there was the issue of whether the admiral was still in communication with the United States. There were undoubtedly other Americans working covertly in Shanghai, most of which would be working for the CIA in some direct or indirect capacity. Yet it was still too early to determine whether Miles would be among this group of his countrymen. He was a major threat to Japan first and foremost, regardless of who he counted among his allies.                                                                                     With that, another round of theorizing was completed by the investigators as they sat around a dingy bar on the outskirts of Shanghai proper. It was now time to enter the admiral's hiding grounds, and root him out by whatever means necessary.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.29.a = Contact Shanghai, now!

jap.dl.30.t = Counterespionage Efforts
jap.dl.30 = Reports have come in from our code breakers that they are overwhelmed with documents. Kenpeitai agents have recovered truly massive amounts of letters and orders from the Juntong in recent weeks, with caches of the paper trail coming in by the truckload to clandestine offices.                                                                                     Even with the most powerful computing systems running day and night, members of our technical and decryption departments have complained they simply cannot keep up. The best code breaking machines in our arsenal seem to find no pattern in the piles of messages delivered daily. It is near impossible any partisan could create an unbreakable code without help.                                                                                     Some are pointing the finger at Admiral Miles, who probably gets codes created by American computers across the Pacific, and gives them to Dai Li and any other Juntong groups in China. There could even be the possibility that there is internal sabotage, but it is more than likely that these uncrackable codes are more than what Dai Li could create, even at his height of power.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.30.a = Keep them at it; Dai Li's secrets must be found no matter the cost.

jap.dl.31.t = Across the Bridge of Light
jap.dl.31 = Two sounds permeated the hospital room. The first was the consistent and gentle hum of the ceiling fan, which produced an almost soporific aura in the space that the fan overlooked. The second sound was that of coughing, vicious and painful coughing that would have made one think that the man unfortunate enough to be producing the sound was having his lungs torn apart.                                                                                     The patient had come a long way from his comfortable rural childhood across the seas. Yet, here he was in Shanghai, an Australian merchant who had sold rare herbs from the Chinese countryside to rich westerners for over twenty years. Much had been achieved, both above and under the table.                                                                                     But, he would never be able to return home at this point, no matter how hard he tried. He was simply too sick, and at this point, unhooking him from the machines in the hospital would be to let the cancer take over. Could he have done more towards his ultimate goals, could he have been a better ally to his friend? He thought it a shame that he might not live long enough to witness the fall of the Sphere. At least he would have hastened its demise, perhaps more than he had anticipated.                                                                                     The former trader turned his weary head towards the window. The sun was beginning to set, casting a bright orange glow over Shanghai. The trader seemed to breathe easier, and eventually the gentle hum of the fan above him lulled him into a sleep from which he did not wake.                                                                                     Although somewhat well known, the trader had remained somewhat of a mystery to his peers. He had not written a will, and had seemingly no friends or family to mourn him. However, there was a small note that he had scribbled one request upon for those who would be tasked with burying him. It was a simple enough thing to ask; to be buried in his old uniform. It had been kept in a box near to his deathbed, folded with great care and respect. As it was taken out of its container, the nurse couldn't help but notice the golden name plate fastened upon the breast pocket: Admiral Milton E. Miles.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.32.t = A Grave
jap.dl.32 = After securing the city, they had moved on the financial district, hoping to locate the admiral before he could react to their presence. Many Shanghainese had indeed heard of a western trader, either from Australia or possibly the United States. He had in fact arrived some decades ago, and quickly blended in among the traditional-style shops and stalls of the district outskirts.                                                                                     He had seemingly disappeared only a few years ago, having closed up his shop and said his last goodbyes to his business associates. At the very least, they were able to locate the supposed trader's shop. The new owners had met their predecessor only very briefly. Some weeks later he had been buried up on a hill outside the city.                                                                                     It was a simple, almost unmarked grave, hidden among many others of its kind. A simple, if elegantly crafted cross marked the spot. The name upon it was false, that of some persona that Admiral Milton E. Miles had created for himself. He had apparently died in the December of 1961, something that concerned the investigators greatly. The next step was crude enough, but necessary. The dead man was dug up and found to be wearing Admiral Miles' uniform. Hospital records confirmed that he had indeed been dying of cancer, and doctors were just about able to recognise his photograph, even without the beard he had grown during his time in Shanghai.                                                                                     They had finally reached the trail's end. The last few interrogations yielded little more than to lead them back to that same grave, where the trail would go icy cold over and over again. The dead man could only be Admiral Miles. There was nothing to suggest he had faked his own death and nothing to suggest that the SACO files had been deliberately made inaccurate. The trail had ended. Fujiwara was left puzzled by the revelation. It provided a sense of finality, yet raised new concerns. Most of all, it cast a shadow of doubt over the entire conspiracy now that one of its key figures had in fact been dead for some time now. Progress had been made, but now was certainly not the time to rest easy.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.33.t = Creeping Doubts
jap.dl.33 = Investigations in Shanghai led only to dead ends, quite literally. In a plain, small graveyard in the city, Kenpeitai agents found their man - Milton Miles, Rear Admiral.                                                                                     While the gravestone obviously did not say his name, it was quick for investigators to piece together that the English-speaking smuggler who had been ignored by Shanghai police and died in his early 60s was one of the dangerous lapdogs of Dai Li and his master plan. The body would have to be checked to fully authenticate their discovery, but it was already agreed upon by everyone present that it was Admiral Miles.                                                                                     "The man's been dead for almost ten damn years," an investigator snarled over the phone, "We have investigators and local police closing off the graveyard to do more analysis, but this is a man dead for ten years!" On the end of the line, his coworker in a Tokyo office attempted to calm him down, but he refused. "Tell me why the hell one of our three biggest suspects has turned out to be dead. The army finally realized Dai Li isn't dead, and now we find out Miles is. Doesn't this seem a-"                                                                                     The phone hung up. The investigator cursed, another dead end. But how on Earth is a supposedly dead man alive, and a supposedly alive man dead?                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.33.a = Something is wrong...

jap.dl.34.t = Oath in Ash Garden
jap.dl.34 = The skies were choked up by smoke and rubble no matter how far away they were from the carnage. In a hill close by the city, the three men could do little but observe, in silent horror, as a metropolis of millions was pillaged no differently than the Mongols would have centuries before. The old temples and forts were shattered, and the lush parks and gardens had been burnt to cinders. It did not feel like an act of man, but the wrath of a higher power.                                                                                     Lieutenant-General Dai Li turned to his two comrades before breaking the silence they had kept since they arrived. To his right stood Li Kenong. A longtime opponent since the generalissimo began to purge the communists from his clique, now one of the only men he could trust. Aside from them was American, Admiral Miles, silently mouthing a prayer at the sight of unimaginable devastation.                                                                                     Dai Li thought back to the millennia old tales of the Three Kingdoms, of three noble and cunning leaders meeting to become blood brothers. Yet great princes with honor would have had no answer for a foe which could bring death on land, air, and sea. Their peach garden was reduced to ash.                                                                                     And as Chongqing burned, the three men made an oath that this would not be the end. Japan would answer for what they did in Chongqing and dozens of other cities.                                                                                     "We will fight," Dai Li said, "We will never give up this burden, until Japan burns like this garden." With that, the three men descended from the hillside, bound together as the leaders of a war that would not end until Japan was brought down and vanquished.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.35.t = Kenpeitai Trail
jap.dl.35 = Deep underneath Tokyo's Intelligence Headquarters, buried beneath nearly thirty meters of concrete and steel, two men sat in a bare room.                                                                                     "Mr. Isuzu, I hope you understand the seriousness of filing a report of treason in this investigation." the investigator said, calm underneath the incandent bulb. "If your claim is even the slightest bit incorrect, you'll be terminated from this investigation."                                                                                     Mr. Isuzu's eyes darted frantically across the room. He had a theory, but who else would believe it? It would bring the whole investigation crashing down. It made no sense, but he felt it to be the case. "Investigator Kawashima, I work for the decryption department. We've been seeing nothing but failure in our efforts. Every day the Kenpeitai deliver us piles of 'acquired documents' from raids, but there is no pattern." He cleared his throat before continuing, "These papers are not code, they are random characters and words thrown together."                                                                                     The investigator took a cigarette out from his pocket. "Isn't it your job to separate this randomness? I do understand the delays in codebreaking, and I can tell you there are people far more powerful than either of us who want it done now."                                                                                     "Investigator, I am telling you, look at this!" Mr. Isuzu opened a folder of documents labelled as unimportant. "We have checked this against Juntong codes, German, American, even old Russian ones! The Kenpeitai are giving us pointless documents that aren't ever meant to be solved."                                                                                     "Dai Li could just be-"                                                                                     In a moment of defiance, perhaps Mr. Isuzu's most daring action of his life, he cut off Kawashima. "The Kenpeitai are sending these, investigator. I can't see any other answer. I swear to you it is true, Investigator Kawashima!" He grew more frantic with each sentence, slamming his fist down on the metal table. "They're giving us nothing! You can ask anyone else, I swear! The Kenpeitai are hiding something, I can feel it. Please, look into it! They are not telling us everything!"                                                                                     As Mr. Isuzu collapsed into his seat, Mr. Kawashima looked at him with a mix of shock and fury. It couldn't be true. He was a madman, driven to lunacy in order to justify his lack of progress. He stood up and left the room, gathering Mr. Isuzu's files with him. Before he closed the heavy door, he remarked, with the thought beginning to gnaw at his mind, that maybe this seemingly crazed man had an inkling of truth to his theory.                                                                                                                                                                          .

The leading body in the investigation thus far, the Kenpeitai has given little reason for us to suspect them in being involved in the conspiracy itself, being of decent standing - especially compared to our 'allies' in the Nanjing government. However, it does not, and should not rule them out from investigative scrutiny, especially given the fact they have connections to the Imperial Japanese Army's entire command structure.                                                                                     It must be said however, that investigating leads to the IJA would need to be threaded very very carefully, for if we are suspected of trying to break their monopolies on power, they would react in means that would threaten the very stability of our government, let alone the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.37.t = A Network of Relations
jap.dl.37 = Despite being the ones to initially bring up the matter of Dai Li's possible infiltration of the military, the Kenpeitai had since then kept rather quiet on the matter. While their aid in bringing the matter to the attention of the Home Minister was a significant sign of loyalty and trust, some of the investigating officers wondered if the Kenpeitai's newfound silence was a cause of concern. It might have been possible that Dai Li had infiltrated their lower ranks too, in order to remain one step ahead of his adversaries.                                                                                     Despite their well-meaning and ultimately friendly request to examine the Kenpeitai for signs of conspirator infiltration, the investigators were told to stand down by the military upon each attempt they made. Even the Home Minister received a sign of the military's scrutiny, in the form of a letter, encouraging him to "focus his attention on the actual investigation". Not wanting to be seemingly pacified by these idle demands to both himself and his investigators, the Home Minister began to consider what he could do to break through the military blockade. There were still many within the army and navy who he could count as allies. Some even owed him favors going years back. The minister had a few phone calls to make and even a couple of letters to write.                                                                                     Within a few days, the investigators were finally granted access to sections of the army and navy's records, particularly regarding finance. It was, at the very least, a decent starting point. In order to investigate the Kenpeitai themselves, they would need to discover the reasons for the military's stubbornness. Hopefully, they would crack without too much resistance.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.38b.t = Initial Findings
jap.dl.38b = Simply put, the investigation could not find anything relevant to the conspiracy. The navy, ever reluctant to submit to interrogations and to hand over their files, had still provided the investigating agents with enough information to reach a conclusion. It was certainly a disappointing end to another few weeks of hard work for them.                                                                                     They had examined financial, recruitment and diplomatic records for tracers of anything incriminating, and turned up empty handed. Interviews provided little else of use to the investigation. Even a number of ships were searched; cargo was opened and checked and some boats were even partially dismantled to check for hidden compartments or storage areas. Nothing beyond the official records was ever found. It would never be quite possible to tell exactly what the navy was doing, for there was certainly a number of secrets that they would rather die than let slip, but they were not harbouring the pawns of Dai Li.                                                                                     While the lack of proper results was never a positive, the Home Minister was at least relieved to be able to check the navy off the list. The amusing thought of holding any and all meetings relevant to the Dai Li situation on navy ships from this point crossed his mind before he regained focus. There were other paths for the investigation to pursue. He hoped that they would be resolved as easily as the navy had been.                                                                                     Some had suggested that attempting to clear the army of suspicion would be a wise choice. It was in many ways quite dangerous to let either branch of the military operate without being cleared of suspicions, especially if Dai Li had turned so many officers into his puppets. Yet examining the military had certain... political complications too, just as with the navy.                                                                                     As the Home Minister began to retire for the night, his head was filled with the choices he would once again have to make. It was never an easy choice, seemingly growing more difficult as the options narrowed. Failure seemed like a dangerously palpable possibility as this point. It would be another long night for the Home Minister.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.39b.t = Army Pressure
jap.dl.39b = The first day of the investigation of the army went swimmingly. A number of departments were swept clean of any suspicion, having been cleared by the investigating officers. They had chosen to begin their investigation at the lowest levels, among the recently promoted junior officers. Among these enthusiastic and oftentimes fanatical army men, there was little sign infiltration or serious corruption. Apart from the odd case of a disciplinary issue, which was better handled by the army anyway, the investigators came across nothing of any note to cause them concern.                                                                                     Moving up the chain of command yielded some more resistance and overall reluctant on the part of the 'cooperating' officers. Questions were still answered and files were still promptly delivered to the investigating agents, yet it was clear from the looks on the faces of the interviewees that they were starting to perhaps provoke a sense of discomfort.                                                                                     A couple of days later, the Home Minister received a sharp, yet polite letter from the minister of war. Behind a genial tone, the army minister produced a detailed summary of the actions of the investigating agents. He made a point to highlight the significant number of issues he had found with their conduct. As such, the army minister felt it necessary to inform their superior of this issue and that it would best of all involved if he could ensure that their "over-eagerness to protect the nation" might be dialled back greatly.                                                                                     By "dialled back greatly", the army minister was in truth asking for the investigation of the army to come to an end, or at the very least become a mere reenactment of a security check. The army was not afraid to apply pressure when need be, it seemed. The Home Minister was in truth not obliged to obey the request of his fellow minister, even with the potential consequences looming in low. There was no need to turn back now, he thought.                                                                                                                                                                          .

The army, already somewhat reluctant in their cooperation, quickly turned against the agents in subtle ways.                                                                                     Interviews began to drag on for much longer. The officers being questioned would either jump around answering the agents, or produce absurdly long answers that never seemed to quite reach any sort of true meaning. The investigators met great difficulty in even getting the army to provide them with officers willing to be questioned. If they ever agreed to be interrogated, they would arrive late or only comply with meeting the agents at particularly late or early hours.                                                                                     Not even physical evidence could be relied upon at this point. The army was surprisingly happy to honour the request made by the investigators to see a number of files relating to their finances, recruitment and interactions with other sections of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the files were not suddenly lost in transit across the bureaucratic web, then they ended up being severely damaged in transit. The few files that did arrive in decent condition turned out to be the wrong documents and were sent back, never to be heard of again.                                                                                     The investigators back to the Home Minister did not paint a picture of a particularly functional work environment for his agents. Despite it all, some scant progress had been made, mostly by rearranging ripped, or possibly shredded, papers. This had been part of what he had anticipated the army's initial response to be. There was still much work to be done, and yet at the same time, the pressure was becoming a serious problem. The Home Minister could either continue his investigation, or cut his losses and try another route. Neither option seemed particularly pleasant to him as he considered the possibilities to come.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.40b.a = We have stepped too carelessly.
jap.dl.40b.b = Not one step back! Continue the investigation!

jap.dl.41.t = Initial Findings
jap.dl.41 = The investigation was, on the surface, going well. The agents were not treated particularly well by their hosts across a number of army offices and barracks. They were met with stern and almost defiant glances as they went about their work. Files arrived on time and interviews were carried out, always together with those seemingly ubiquitous looks of anger. Yet the agents were still able to carry out their task, albeit with an uncomfortable aura around them at all times. The investigation swept through a number of low level sections of the army and in seemingly very little time. The daunting and dangerous upper levels were next.                                                                                     Fortunately for them, there would be a number of assets, courtesy of the Home Minister, to aid them. A number of 'aligned' army personnel would make sure the operation ran smoothly. If one soldier refused to deliver a document, it would soon enough be delivered by a superior officer. Interviews went by without too much difficulty, as a word or two from the Home Minister kept the army mostly in check. It was enough to make the officers know that cooperation would lead to a hastened promotion and not a hastened retirement. All in all, the assistance of the Home Minister was more than enough to aid his investigation.                                                                                     Among the plethora of unusual and suspicious documents collected by the investigating agents, a selection of financial records stood out the most. The first detail of note, was that they concerned a number of Kenpeitai officers. The second detail was that these officers had become obscenely wealthy over the course of only a few weeks. Money had seeming been poured into the welfare of these military police officers, yet at no point did the record state why this had been authorised.                                                                                     A new series of interviews, all approved with great reluctance, by the minister of war, were conducted. Some of the soldiers had heard rumours of fortunes materialising for certain officers among the Kenpeitai. What these rumours hadn't told them anything of a source for the yen, the soldiers had come to an agreed hypothesis. It was simple enough - the Kenpeitai was now in the business of accepting particularly large bribes.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.41.a = Something fishy indeed.

jap.dl.42.t = The Analysis of the Transferred Money
jap.dl.42 = While the Kenpeitai officers were currently out of reach, having been reported as "out on covert assignment", their families were not. Fortunately for the investigation, that was where the trail of money led them. The Kenpeitai official's suddenly discovered fortunes had not been sent directly to their bank accounts. Instead, the money had gone towards their close relations, whether that be their girlfriends, wives, parents or siblings.                                                                                     The interviews with these relatives went well. Some coaxing was initially required, as many of them felt anxious about their money possibly being taken away from them. Their fears were eventually quelled with the realisation of the investigators' actual interest. Among those questioned, the universal story was that of a charitable donation having been made to them due to their Kenpeitai family member. The benefactor was always anonymous, at least to the recipients of their money.                                                                                     Theories raged as to just where the money could be coming from. Naturally, there were many ideas tossed about beyond the money merely coming from Dai Li, or an associate of his. Some suggested interference from powerful business groups, perhaps a keiretsu trying to utilise members of the Kenpeitai against their competitors. Possible American involvement was the idea that intrigued the investigators most. They wouldn't put it past the CIA to attempt to corrupt part of the military police into leaking valuable information or to overlook one or two spies.                                                                                     Hypotheses aside, there was still much work to do to verify any one of them. The reports of mysterious sums of yen appearing out of thin air were certainly not good signs, no matter who the cash originally belonged to in the first place. The paper trail was there, the agents needed only to locate it.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.42.a = The signs of corruption are certainly there.

jap.dl.43.t = Meetings in Shanghai
jap.dl.43 = As they so often do, the trail was found far from where the investigation had least expected it. The Home Minister, as per his job description, had contacts in virtually every branch of the Japanese government and military. Most rumours therefore made their way to his ears sooner or later. Loose lips in the Daihonei provided him with a rather peculiar fact: A number of Kenpeitai officers were on their way to Shanghai. Not only this, but orders supposedly from a Dai Li agent had just been intercepted outside the city. It was simply too big of a coincidence for the investigation to pass up on.                                                                                     With a sense of direction restored, the investigating agents rushed to their new target. The investigation would look towards local officials for possible leads. A large enough bribe or a serious enough threat made all but the most stubborn of them comply with the investigation. Piece by piece, the trail reformd once again, all of the Kenpeitai agents had booked into the Astor House Hotel.                                                                                     It was simple enough to 'win' the hotel over to their side. A phone call from the Home Minister assured the Astor House's manager that they would receive a rather generous donation should they comply with the investigation's demands. Relatively few of the officers left the hotel for more than a stroll through the streets, most stayed in their rooms or gathered in the lobby to discuss trivial matters. Yet after about two days of this seemingly dull routine, the officers would one by one visit the reception desk and book themselves into the conference room. They would all be attending some sort of meeting between two and five o'clock the next day, and at least two unnamed individuals would be joining them.                                                                                     As the day of the meeting arrived, the investigation, together with local police units, stood ready to burst into the hotel conference room and arrest all those present. For that to happen, they would need the express approval of the senior investigating officer, who acted as an emissary for the Home Minister. Until he gave the command, the agents of the Home Ministry would watch the meeting, lest they miss some important building.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.43.a = We need evidence of a crime taking place.
jap.dl.43.b = Arrest them immediately!

jap.dl.44a.t = "Observation Continues"
jap.dl.44a = ""There's still plenty of time and they are unaware of our presence". By order of their senior officer, the investigation would hold off on their strike against the Kenpeitai. They had three hours to witness a crime taking place. After that, the officers would disperse around the building, making it much harder to take them in for questioning. For the moment, the agents of the Home Minister would stand by, waiting for the proper moment to arrest everyone inside the conference room. Observations continued, as they were joined by members of the Shanghai police force.                                                                                     The conference itself was proving to be rather dull. Although it had officially begun, the Kenpeitai officers present were still idly talking amongst themselves, with seemingly no coherent conversation between the lot of them. They could only be awaiting something to happen, that was seemingly out of their hands. An hour passed and still nothing happened. From their vantage point in a dubiously acquired apartment across the street, the agents could see the senior Kenpeitai being to check his watch more frequently. They were overdue for something to happen, possibly a late arrival.                                                                                     Another hour passed and the mood in the conference room was growing more and more uneasy. They had been aware of some sort of delay, but nothing of this length. The conference would be over, at least officially, in just under one hour. All the agents could do was continue to wait.                                                                                                                                                                          .
jap.dl.44a.a = "Patience..."

jap.dl.45a.t = "A Surprising Visitor"
jap.dl.45a = "It was a quarter to three. Outside the Astor House, the agents of the Home Minister's investigation were still waiting for signs of a crime taking place in the conference room of the hotel. A way of discomfort was beginning to set in over the investigation, as they wondered if this had all been ruse, designed to draw their attention while the real clandestine gathering went on undetected. This unease seemed to grow all the more real as the seconds ticked by, summoning up images of the Home Ministry agents being caught in a trap themselves. Just as quickly as those images were summoned, they were then banished by an agent speaking over the radio...                                                                                     "Wait... I think we might finally have something." A particularly unremarkable man, who had nearly escaped the attention of the agent stationed near the hotel's entrance, had just entered the conference room. To the agents monitoring the development from afar, he looked as though he might have been just another Kenpeitai officer, using a heavy coat and wide-brimmed hat to cover disguise himself out on the streets. Yet as he removed his garments, it became clear that he was very much not just another of the assembled men.                                                                                     His clothes were not what caught the eyes of the agents, but his face. That was a face they had seen before. During the very beginning of the investigation, a dossier containing files on anyone close to Dai Li not accounted for during war had been passed around. The very same face had appeared in an old photograph of Dai Li, standing right beside him. The man in Astor House had aged of course, but it could be him.                                                                                     A near deathly silence took hold over the agents, as they watched the Kenpeitai calmly listen to the Dai Li operative, as if they had all met many times before and become the most trusted of allies. Finally, the Home Ministry's senior agent gave the command.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.dl.46a = "Sometimes, when one is trying to extract information from a stubborn source, one is forced to rely on older methods of interrogation. This was the case with the investigation and their newly 'acquired' Kenpeitai prisoners. While they were hardened men of military background, there were still a number of methods that could prove effective. Many of those methods were ones that the Kenpeitai had employed themselves, tried and tested across the Sphere. The native Shanghai Police had been particularly forthcoming with the details of this methods of interrogation, having heard the stories of their application over the years. Behind clothes and bolted doors, the agents of the investigation began their bloody and agonizing work.                                                                                     One by one, the Kenpeitai officers were escorted to a small room at the back of the police station. After an invariable amount of time, they would return. Some had been cut, others beaten, some had been burned and others seemingly electrocuted. The investigation knew that they could withstand most forms of torture, and that killing one of them 'by mistake' would not soften them up during questioning. This would be a battle of attrition. The longer that they were locked up, away from the wider world, the more worn down they would become. If they started to believe that no help was coming for them, then they would snap. After all, if this was loyalty's reward, then what good was keeping military secrets, really?                                                                                     The military had been aware of the matter for some time, however. The dramatic raid of the Astor House has been hard for them to miss, and army intelligence was quickly able to locate where the Kenpeitai officers were being held. With the knowledge that the Kenpeitai officers were being detained, the Daihonei was swift to issue a diplomatic protest against the investigation. While the Home Minister would keep the army busy by means of rescheduling their meetings about the matter at the last moment, the investigation would continue their interrogations. As long as the Kenpeitai were kept ignorant of the world outside, then they would eventually tell the agents everything they needed to know...                                                                                                                                                                          .

Even with this fact, the agents elected to use more reasonable and subtle measures to acquire the information they needed. One would have been foolish to write all of the prisoners off as die-hard military loyalists, as shown by their willingness to take bribes from mysterious benefactors. Perhaps if their financial situations were to be taken care off, then they would be open to discussing their backroom deals.                                                                                     Other methods were employed too. Officers who had expressed great faith in the military soon arriving to release them were specifically told that they had been abandoned by their superiors. Some of the Kenpeitai were subjected to volleys of questions, that were directed to them at random with either a great deal of aggression or geniality.                                                                                     Stubbornness had been expected, considered by the investigation to be part and parcel when dealing with members of the military, yet breaking them down was certainly not impossible. Cut off from the world, isolated from even each other and subjected to constant and repetitive questioning, the signs of their slipping composure would soon become more and more apparent. Eventually, their hope of the military intervening would begin to fade.                                                                                                                                                                          .

Why were you meeting the Kenpeitai?"

The contact cleared his throat, producing a loud and phlegm-filled wheeze. He was met with two pairs of vicious eyes. "When this all began, did the behaviour of the Kenpeitai not trouble you? Did you not question how forthcoming they were about Dai Li?

For all I know, he could be living as a hermit in Tibet! Ever since the war ended, the Kenpeitai have been forcing me to snuff out resistance movements in China. If they knew where he was, I would have been used against him."                                                                                     He was struck across the face again. "Everything you have gathered up to this point confirms this! Why were they so forthcoming about the rumours of Dai Li murdering unsuspecting Japanese soldiers? Why tell you this, and then refuse to aid you? Every time you've lifted the curtain just a little bit higher than the Kenpeitai, what have you found? Nothing."                                                                                     The agents of the investigation did not respond.

Despite the occasional punch or baton to the stomach, the prisoners arrived mostly in one piece. They were to be isolated from one another, with each one getting their own remote cell. Interviews began shortly after, before any one of the Kenpeitai officers had time to devise a smart enough alibi.                                                                                     It quickly became clear that the Kenpeitai were more than prepared for being questioned. They all remained calm during their questioning, speaking only to answer questions and always giving a succinct answer. As more time passed without the investigation being able to extract any information from the Kenpeitai officers, the more dangerous their imprisonment became. Sooner or later, the army would get word of the conference having been raided, and begin causing a serious diplomatic meltdown back in Japan. Time was running out for the investigating agents.                                                                                                                                                                          .

Takeichi Takamura had strolled into his office earlier than usual, hanging up his coat and marching across the room to begin his work.                                                                                     As Takamura turned to make his way over to his seat, and his eyes glanced over his silent office, a moment of singularity struck him - an unopened letter rested on his desk. The entire room seemed to surround the letter; his eyes were fixated on the papers as he froze for a short while. He already knew why it was there, and why it was placed on his desk so unannounced. It was a display of force, and a way to show the detective the stakes without challenging him in the public eye. He exhaled slowly through his nose and scrambled to grab the letter, eager to discover what it read.                                                                                     Takamura's eyes danced through the clear lines of the letter and scoured the countless words, but it all meant one thing. The powerful in the IJA objected to the arrest of Kenpeitai agents in Shanghai, and they were not afraid to intimidate the investigation team with their objections. He tossed the letter across his desk and reached for the back of his neck, leaning back in his chair. Anxious panic bubbled up in his stomach as images of secret dealings shot through his mind. In the ratways between governmental departments, these men moved in the shadows to get their own way; it was a move the detective could not afford to play as long as he was burdened with the watchful gaze of the nation.

The contact would receive just enough care to keep him alive and slowly recovering, but not enough comfort to allow him to relax in the face of interrogation. While the investigation might need to hold off on their most aggressive and uncomfortable methods, there were still plenty of options for how they could squeeze information out of the Dai Li operative.                                                                                     The Kenpeitai agents on the other hand, were left in their cells. The investigation had little interest in the mere acomplacies of the Dai Li, especially now that they had a direct link to the man himself. By keeping them merely locked up and well fed, the army could do little more than grumble. They, of course, would demand the release of the Kenpeitai officers, but beyond that they were essentially powerless as long as the officers were not directly harmed.                                                                                     Without any form of anaesthetic, the Chinese contact was in constant pain. His broken limbs were suspended to keep them straight while healing, only served to drag out his excruciating experience. An anaesthetic was of course readily available, as the agents were ever so willing to inform him. There was a catch, as expected. The anaesthetic was available to him should he be willing to part with everything he knew about Dai Li and his connections to the Japanese army. He was asked to answer this on several occasions, but the agents would always be met with a blank stare. Even when they put just a little bit of pressure on his broken bones, they would only elicit a slight wince or twinge, never more.

As if in response, the officer's eyes snapped open. He attempted to lift himself but was forced to the ground. His eyes became fixed to the ceiling for a good moment, before he exhaled.                                                                                     "You're never going to find Dai Li.

Yet here you are, at your wit's end, looking for ghosts and conspiracies!"                                                                                     He laughed, but a kick to the ribs cut him short. The officer spluttered on the floor, before resuming, there was a rage in his voice.

The Home Minister put down the receiver and prepared to deliver the news to the Prime Minister. He had been expecting an awful conspiracy to be uncovered, that the military was utterly compromised and posed to strike at the government. Yet now that he knew the truth, that he had been leading his entire ministry on a ghost hunt, he felt even more disturbed. There was no time to dwell on the matter, not when the Prime Minister needed to be informed as well.                                                                                     The office of his superior was lit only by the setting sun as the Home Minister entered, casting beams of pinkish light across the floor and right-hand wall. The Home Minister gave his best bow and approached the desk. "Sir, I have finally received the reports from my agents, they bring news of a great... but deeply troubling development that we could not have anticipated." The Prime Minister pored over the documents, while his minister could not help but watch the look of concern and spread over his face.                                                                                     Finally, the Prime Minister raised his head from the mass of papers. "But this suggests... that Dai Li's return was little more than a byproduct of Kenpeitai mismanagement. You cannot mean to tell me that we have been led astray by panic alone?" The Home Minister seemed to struggle with bringing forth the necessary words before finally speaking. "I-... I am afraid so, sir. Our every investigative path leads us either to a dead end or back to the initial report. The rumour of Dai Li infiltrating the army simply falls apart when one examines the situation more closely. This has been a ploy to keep us distracted."                                                                                     It was the Prime Minister's turn to be without the capabilities of speech. He instead turned towards the window with his mouth covered by a hand, watching as the sun disappeared over the horizon. The room fell into darkness. "I need you to find more proof of this disaster, raid every Kenpeitai office if you must. This matter needs to die." As he spoke, the Prime Minister did not turn from the window.

Not wanting to waste any more time, lest the Kenpeitai discovered that they were compromised, he had contacted the navy. Nanjing was the heart of the military police's power - except for around the ports, they could be found patrolling the streets in equal frequency to the IJA. To crack open their headquarters, the navy would have to provide the manpower.                                                                                     Below decks on an IJN warship, a unit of the Special Naval Landing Force prepared to storm the streets leading up the Kenpeitai compound. Surprise was their biggest advantage, as there was no reason to believe the military police had any idea of their presence or impending strike. Their orders were simple: open a path to the heart of the compound and seize any documents housed within. Resistance was to be met with force.                                                                                     Three boats departed from a warship under the cover darkness, each one filled to capacity with marines of the SNLF. Upon entering the Nanjing port, the marines climbed up onto the docks and headed deeper into the city. The unit then split in two and readied themselves to pincer the compound.                                                                                     The lone guard at the back gate of Kenpeitai HQ was quietly dispatched. A rifle stock which emerged from the shadows connected with his jaw, knocking him to the ground. Meanwhile, a similar scene took place at the side door, where the guard was startled by the marines, before he too was knocked unconscious. With everyone in position, the raid began. Doors at both the back and side of the building were kicked open as dozens of SNLF troops swarmed in. Within thirty seconds, most of the ground floor had been taken without as much as a shot having been fired. Only the military police near the armory and barracks put up much of a fight, although overwhelming gunfire from all sides eventually dislodged them. The building was filled with the sounds of marines rushing towards the upper floors. The race was now on to find the Kenpeitai's archive before any of them had the bright idea to burn it all to the ground.                                                                                                                                                                          .

To the Juntong soldiers who called Dai Li a commander, this was all part of the nightly routine. At the end of the day, he would seclude himself in his farmhouse, drink until he could no longer stand and then fall into an inebriated stupor. His men cared not, they in fact appreciated the calm after the drunken storm. Silence meant that they could rest and avoid Dai Li's cruel gaze. Even so, the coughing was particularly vile that night. When it was suggested that someone should check on him, the idea was immediately shot down. Disturbing his 'sleep' was deeply unwise and it usually ended in someone being beaten to the ground. The Juntong would simply have to sleep through the tortuous noise.                                                                                     The morning usually began with Dai Li viciously waking everyone by whatever means he felt necessary. Yet this morning, Dai Li was nowhere to be found. The decision was made to now finally check on him. Inside the farmhouse, the Juntong found the corpse of their commander. The open eyes and mouth, pallid skin and bloody phlegm on his shirt was enough to confirm it then and there. For about a minute, no one dared to even move. Not one among them had considered what to do once the bastard actually died. Some had even thought he was going to outlive them all. The silence was then broken by a suggestion everyone found agreeable.

The body was carried to a clearing deep in the woods and buried in an unmarked grave quickly. No one stayed at the spot for long. Once they had all returned to the farmhouse, the former Juntong exchanged looks and departed. Some wished to return home, most simply wanted a home to return to.

As the haze cleared from the entranceway to the Kenpeitai archives, the bodies of three military police lay scattered on the ground. Where most had simply laid down their guns or tried to run, it seemed that these men were willing to die for what they were guarding. While the commander of the SNLF unit trudged through the blood-strewn and bullet-ridden corridor, he quickly noticed that the door to the archive was firmly locked.

He wasted no time in unlocking the door. Fearing that he might still have arrived too late, the sight of untouched shelves and cabinets was a relief.

"According to every verifiable source at our disposal, it would appear that Dai Li has been dead since the late 1950s. The exact cause of his death is not entirely understood, but it can be concluded that alcoholism and general poor health were the contributing factors. Despite the descriptions of events given by some of Dai Li's closet followers, a burial location has not been located either. We are also now aware that Dai Li's followers did not attempt to continue operations following his death. We can therefore assume that the Juntong is no longer a threat to the empire in any capacity."

All of a sudden one evening, a special broadcast interrupted the scheduled programming on both television and radio across Japan. For those watching, the imperial seal appeared on the screen, which was quickly followed by a blaring rendition of the national anthem, which also played on the radio transmission. After a few moments, both the seal and the anthem faded away, into a recording from the office of the Home Minister.

The Kenpeitai, empowered to enforce peace and stability across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, have been uncovered as traitors and turncoats. For several months, they engaged in a scheme to sow chaos and disorder throughout Asia, in hopes of toppling the emperor's government. Rumours of long-dead Chinese rebels and terrorists were spread to deliberately mislead and demoralize the government and armed forces of the empire. However, due to the swift investigation of these falsehoods, they were dispelled and traced to their source. The Kenpeitai have been pacified, their compounds and offices stormed by the loyal troops of the empire. Their plot, and their very organisation is no more. These traitors will be treated as what they are, enemies of state and to kokutai.

It arrived onto the Prime Minister's desk, a seal of the army granting its envelope protection against prying eyes. A top-secret matter, then, for both the army and the Government of Japan. The letter lay in the open, its seal exuding a dread from the contents housed within. The question was clear from the start: why all this secrecy?                                                                                     Unbinding the seal, the Prime Minister unfolded the envelope. Inside was a piece of paper, neatly typed and spaced. Its contents were unremarkable. The army planned exercises to take place throughout Japan to test the readiness of the troops and reservists in cases of sudden attacks. The reason for secrecy answered itself: the enemy cannot know that Japan prepared to meet its enemy in the field.                                                                                     The implication, however, was grim. The 'Great Conspiracy' as those in-the-know within the cabinet dubbed it, was quickly becoming capable of shaking the very foundation of the Japanese state. Hands trembling, he picked up the telephone's handset. He dialed the number of the army offices and asked to talk to the chief for a moment. After a brief exchange, the army agreed to postpone the exercises for a few days. Collapsing into the chair, the Prime Minister breathed a sigh of relief. He had delayed chaos for a few days.                                                                                                                                                                          .

From the Imperial Palace, it looked as if today would be beautiful, idyllic, even.                                                                                     Lines of uniformed men marched from the navy's base in Yokosuka. Their destination: the palace. The civilian government had failed the people of Japan, and it was up to her sons in the armed services to save her from doom. They were a curiosity to bystanders; armed to the teeth and wearing khaki uniforms, they walked the streets in full view of all they encounter on the way.                                                                                     They were not alone in this line of thought. From the Saitama Prefecture, the army made their own move. Laws and propriety be damned; now is the time for the inferiors to rule from below, outside the structure. If all it took to save Japan were only a few violations of the rules, they would do it every time.

Unslinging their rifles and pointing it at each other, yet refusing to fire, they would garrison the buildings in the capital, maintaining the unstable equilibrium.

Both were unwilling to listen to orders to stand down and held their ground. There was a silver lining, at least: the army and the navy had refused to open fire on one another, and the 1st Guards Divisions were giving and receiving the same treatment.

Judging from his expression, the Prime Minister guessed that the gods hadn't stepped down to stop this madness, only to add more to it.

The news came this morning when the minister's son, who lived close, visited the house and found that someone had broken through the door. In the living room, clutching a revolver in his last moments, was his father, with several bruises and stab wounds on his head and torso. The police found no clear suspects and the army, suspecting the navy to be behind all of this, can barely contain their anger.

He took out a piece of paper and prepared a speech for the inauguration of the new candidate. A few minutes later, just after he finished drafting the address, another aide came, bearing another name. Half an hour later, another one.

He was less angry than shocked and horrified: the army had not agreed to a single candidate, teetering on the edge of collapse.

However, the news reached him: the attack had wounded no one. Sobriety had returned to both the army and the navy, as no further attacks had occurred.

The answer to that question was the military. Throughout the entire Sphere, the army and the navy are both currently engaging in a war of deception - an intensification of the already existing interservice rivalry within an already fragile system. Rumours of officer's purges, assassination lists and equipment procurement flood the civilian government's ministries day by day, yet the Prime Minister still has an ace up his sleeve: the Daihon'ei, the independent joint chiefs of staff that were supposed to coordinate the efforts of the army and the navy.

The second most disastrous call possible outside of a nuclear defense warning.                                                                                     "Hello, Prime Minister? It's the lord keeper - the Daihon'ei has disobeyed imperial orders and have cut off communications. Gather the cabinet this instant."                                                                                                                                                                          .

Earlier in the morning, the Yokosuka Naval Base received reports of a mutiny on board the Yamato, and she is now bound to Tokyo, in a prime position to shell the capital. The radicals aboard her had seized control over the ship, citing the civilian government's inability to handle the current crisis. The naval authority had authorized the deployment of special forces, while the remaining loyalists attempted to distract the ship from opening its anti-air guns.                                                                                     A few kilometers away from the objective, Ishikawa saw the pride of the Japanese fleet - a humongous dreadnought with guns that could tear any other battleship at sea. True to the loyalists' words, the ship's guns were quiet. Too quiet. Ishikawa was expecting a few gunshots to drift their way. The helicopter landed on the Yamato's stern, and the special forces split up. Forty people, with state-of-the-art weapons and gear. Yet, everything was silent. The halls were empty. They stepped down into the hold, ready to meet a burst of machinegun fire.                                                                                     Bodies.

Shimada and three men took point and were greeted by several weary officer cadets with their hands in the air, and weapons on the ground. Bullet-ridden sandbags, blood-stained imperial flags and several dozen corpses, crowned pristinely with headbands scattered the courtyard.

Mr. Kinji staggers, his limp being supported by his two crutches. A veteran of the bloody campaigns of Burma and India, Mr. Kinji has seen it all - proudly giving his campaign service medals a glance before shifting his attention to the television set. "Why isn't anything on, Takeshi? I'm too old for these new-fangled machines..." The fuzzy, static-drenched monochrome television gets clearer with every little twink of the dial, and ever so slowly the screen's static fades into clarity. The scene is the Supreme Court. A flurry of jury members and reporters, one moment ago abuzz with comments and camera flashes are suddenly now silent, standing and awaiting the arrival of the defendant.

Enter the defendant, Field Marshal Mitsuru Ushijima.                                                                                     Mr. Kinji has heard of the conspiracies against officers during his occasional visits to the veterans' association. Personally, he does not care for the nonsense bickering between Army and Navy, instead being more concerned with the ever-increasing numbers of impoverished, destitute Korean labourers taking up jobs in his family businesses. But now, to see his personal commanding officer during some of the toughest campaigns in the war being involved in this mess drove his blood pressure through the roof. The trial continues, and the family intently listens.                                                                                     "Field Marshal Mitsuru Ushijima, you are hereby sentenced to twenty years' prison time on the charges of treason and conspiracy against the Empire of Japan. You will not receive the death sentence in the light of your advanced age and your stellar contributions to this nation.

He scans the room for Takeshi, only to remember him saying he'd be out on a night shift at the Kakureya. Limping towards the TV, he fiddles around with the dials before settling on a channel. "Finally", he thought - "Maybe these modern sets aren't that hard to use after all."

Mr. Kinji rises as the courtroom does, but as the national anthem plays, the veteran sings not for the corruption and injustice plaguing the government, but with pride for the kokutai.

This was the 30s all over again, he thought to himself; of which this was just the beginning. Already, rumours are abound that army units are making lists of who to be purged, who to be roughed up and when the targeted officers get their fates.

To the Prime Minister, the note in itself barely helped with anything, let alone being able to get the investigation moving forward. What the catatonic General wrote however, firmly convinced the Prime Minister to take some sort of action against the slowly unravelling conspiracy.

In their silence, the distant sirens of emergency vehicles and chants from the protesters were audible, urging them to think very carefully on the matters currently at hand. Kido cleared his throat and looked away from the wall he had been staring at, breaking the deafening silence and gathering the frustrated attention of the men he was surrounded by.

No one wanted to speak, but the scowls and glares of all the old, privileged men in the room were loud enough to curse him from where he sat.

He glanced behind him, noticing the great capital, Tokyo, as he stepped onto the platform; her skyscrapers glimmered and glistened in the beaming Japanese sun. Closing his eyes for a brief moment, Nishi knew this would be the last time he would see his homeland.                                                                                     Mr. Nishi was ordered to be exiled away from the Home Isles for his crimes, and was subsequently being sent to Bengal to live out the rest of his days. The humid, foreign lands under the jurisdiction of the Azad Hind government were decided to be his new home as they were the most distant and most alien to what he knew and grew up with in Tokyo. Now doomed to live the life of an outcast, Nishi Takeichi must painfully experience the rejection he could never see as a celebrity across Japan as a punishment for his alleged crimes against the state.                                                                                                                                                                          .

The privy council president's words fell silent on the seemingly motionless emperor. There he sat at his separate table, where he seemed much further away from his advisors than usual. The news of Nishi's trial had not been received well by the chrysanthemum throne, a feeling that he expressed plainly on his face. The emperor had even arrived late to the privy council meeting, which was particularly unusual. For half an hour, he had remained silent, barely even moving his eyes to look at the assembled council. Even the words of the lord keeper of the privy seal had not stirred the emperor enough to say even a simple "yes" or a "no".                                                                                     Regardless, the privy council was desperate for the emperor to speak, as it seemed increasingly likely that his voice would be the only thing that would calm the country. Protests against Nishi's sentence had become increasingly common and most were growing in size by the day. No amount of policing or promises by the government had so far worked. Indeed, the emperor's voice was in fact their last chance.

There had therefore been no time to find him a proper cell. Besides, the protesters outside the courthouse would have likely swarmed the car had they tried to take Nishi much further than a few city blocks away. In the brief moments he had stayed in the cell, Nishi had found the time to consider what he would say before his execution. He would reaffirm his innocence, and once again call on the military to do what was right for the nation. He did not wish to die, but fear was not what filled his mind when he thought about the execution. If anything, he felt disappointed at the state of the nation. How could the emperor let this happen?                                                                                     "Sir?

The second one also bowed, but he presented the colonel with his own sword, retrieved from the armory of the nearby garrison.

jap.dlf.36b = To say Nishi had been lucky was an understatement. The roads back to his house had largely been clear of protests and he had not seen a single police officer along the way. Nor were they any at his house. The colonel had decided to stop by here for a few minutes before going into hiding for some time.                                                                                     His house had been somewhat wrecked in the scuffle during his arrest, but most of his possessions were still here. He packed a few valuables into a large bag, before Nishi realised he had yet to check the stables. Leaving the bag on his bed, he quickly headed out into the garden. To the colonel's great relief, Jupiter was still in his stable, happily munching away on a pile of hay. Nishi gave him a hug around the neck, and then realised that he would have to leave his prize horse behind.                                                                                     That was of course only true if Nishi was to go into hiding. As he looked at Jupiter, the colonel had a thought. There was one more way he could be saved from execution. If he could make an appeal directly to the emperor, then the charges would no longer matter. There was of course a risk that the emperor would not hear his plea or that he would be shot before he could make it to the Imperial Palace. The car would get him there, but why would he use such a meaningless vehicle? There was only one way Nishi was going to do this.                                                                                     The colonel gathered the reins and saddle from the stable and attached them to Jupiter. If he was to die, or be pardoned, Nishi would go to his fate in his own way. He would let all of Tokyo know that he was a man of conviction and courage.

As the horse and its rider rushed past the people on the street, most recognised the man on the horse as Colonel Nishi. When a squad of police cars headed after him, the people of Tokyo only grew more amazed and bewildered.                                                                                     Nishi had not met much trouble on his journey until he reached the city center. The police presence was greatly heightened there; a result of the protests. The element of surprise had favored Nishi though. He was able to ride along the sidewalks and alleyways, providing momentary respite from the police cars. His path was still a chaotic one; Jupiter came close to trampling several bystanders along the way. Nishi would disappear down one street and then reappear moments later; always ahead of his pursuers. Attempts at erecting barricades were soon found to be pointless too. After all, what waist-high obstacle could stop a showjumping horse?                                                                                     As Nishi reached the Imperial Palace gardens, his plan became clear to the police. Pursuit through into the park was impossible for the cars; their only hope was that the Imperial Guard could stop him - said guards had orders to kill anyone who attempted to break into the palace. However, the sight of Colonel Nishi charging straight at them on horseback was enough to freeze them in their tracks. In the end, it was the gate to the palace that stopped Nishi. He dismounted Jupiter, before letting the horse go and began to climb the gate to the Imperial Palace.                                                                                                                                                                          .

Although this was done swiftly, several civilians had witnessed the shooting from across the river.

The government had tried to suppress it, but someone had leaked the result. Nishi was to receive an Imperial Pardon.

They were relentless in their verbal fury against the officers. They cursed Nishi, they cursed the government, they cursed the military, some even cursed the Emperor. They did not care anymore, because the government had shown itself for what it was - A hypocritical, corrupt, and rotten husk. One for which for some there was only one answer; there was only one thought, one driving force that took over those in the crowds.

Bricks came first, thrown at the police lines. Tear gas was fired in response as the police moved to disperse the crowds. The crowd fought back, picking up makeshift weapons and attacking the police. Some of the crowd joined the side of the police, wanting to just end the violence.

However, only a mad man would turn to the army leadership whose cannibalistic actions had brought this country to the brink of disaster. The military offered no solutions, no hope for recovery. That left only the Emperor. A new Imperial decision could calm the public, and hopefully the army as well. It was a difficult decision, but these were difficult times. With a sigh, the Prime Minister picked up the phone and dialed one of the few men in this government he could trust to get this job done, "I need you to meet with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, and acquire our government an audience with the Emperor. Tell him this must happen as soon as possible."                                                                                     The Prime Minister relaxed somewhat.

While most of the former Prime Ministers were blocked by the chaos on the streets and in the Diet, almost all of the Emperor's advisors had arrived, and the chairman of the Privy Council quickly led the discussion. Claims that the Emperor has been too passive in the past, and that the current government was completely inept, were mostly met with affirmative nods.

Kido continued, "While the Privy Council has been rather inactive since the 1930s, desperate times call for desparate measures. If the civilian government is inept, and the military is gutted, then it falls to us to lead Japan away from destruction. Nobody else has managed to do so," this sentiment is once again echoed by the rest of the Jushin, with Konoe and a small handful of others remaining silent.

Some cheered, some were more hopeful. A majority were growing more confused. Something was going on beyond; this was not just a response to the chaos. It was one thing for a government to resign, it was another for the Yokusankai to join them. Confusion only grew when more rumors reached the crowds across Japan.                                                                                     More government officials were resigning, at local and national levels. Ministers, accountants, aides, heads of agencies. Within three hours nearly every leading civil servant had resigned, some with a terse explanation, most with no explanation at all. A foreboding gripped the crowds as the implication of what was happening dawned on them.                                                                                     There was only one body, one individual, who had the power to force the government to do this, and as the hours passed, and more and more resigned from their posts, the truth could no longer be denied.                                                                                                                                                                          .

Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko appeared on the screen and his voice filled the airwaves. "Citizens of the Empire," he began. "The chaos is at an end. Those who are responsible for this anarchy unbefitting of our great nation and people, have been removed from their positions. I have been charged with restoring the Constitutional Order over the Empire of Japan, in the Emperor's name."                                                                                     The news was met with an uncertain silence from the people. What did restoring the Constitutional Order mean? The Prince was known to the public, and some took comfort in that - but questions remained. Questions that no one dared ask now. But one thing was clear.

"A new cabinet will be established to lead the Empire, one devoid of the ideological and partisan divisions of the previous administration, who will work against the radicalism that threatens us. All legislation will be moved through the Diet via Imperial Ascent, and new elections will be held when the Emperor is satisfied that order has been restored," Higashikuni continued. "The military has been ordered to stand down. They will be made to answer for their role in the Great Conspiracy that has caused this chaos."

A political equilibrium of sorts was becoming established, and elements of the previous status quo were resettling. Many of the conservatives and hardliners were pleased that the Emperor - and his advisors - had taken control of the situation. The reformists that remained were displeased, but those who were smart said nothing.

A confession from the head of the Kenpeitai, confessing to being behind the Dai Li Conspiracy in an attempt to shore up their influence, while naming his accomplices. It had taken a methodical investigation to get to the truth, but the mystery was over. The Kenpeitai and military leadership had been cleaned out, and the latter properly leashed by Imperial command.

Make corrections where they previous leaders had gone wrong. Yet the stakes were high; perhaps higher than ever now. They acted in the name of the Emperor, and if they were ultimately judged wanting...he did not know what would happen. He resolved that they never would find out.

The government was struggling to do anything these days: governance was increasingly beyond the Yokusankai. The Diet was filled to the brim with recriminations and personal insults, and the protests were increasingly becoming too much for civilian authority and policemen to handle. Tokyo was awash with instability, as were Osaka and Nagasaki; even small cities such as Sapporo and Kumamoto reported activity and anger of a scale unheard of since the Great Depression.                                                                                     The Imperial Japanese Army, on the other hand, was also on the end of its tether. Having humiliated itself by allowing paranoia to take hold and cause it to cannibalize itself, and permitting the Navy to blame it for its problems too, the Army leadership now felt backed into a corner, assailed from all sides. Whispers of "it cannot be helped" and "we have nothing to lose" percolated throughout Army garrisons, and these whispers soon became calls for harsher action.                                                                                     As the situation worsened, the IJA, seemingly contrite over its actions that had led Japan to this pass, requested permission to assist the civilian government in keeping order.

In hushed tones, he relayed it to his close confidant, Hattori Takushiro, who in turn relayed it through his Army connections like a spreading virus. The nation was on the verge of total collapse, they whispered to listening ears. Incompetent civilians were turning the Empire into a joke, pardoning criminals and throwing honest soldiers behind bars, gutting the troops as the Americans and Germans sunk their hooks further and further in. The people were in the streets, burning city blocks to the ground. Something had to be done.                                                                                     It had started with feigning contrition, bending to the Prime Minister, politely requesting to assist him in restoring order. It was almost funny that that had been the most difficult part of the plan, and the government had fallen for it without a second thought. Now, Akira held his plotting rod, stiffly leveling it at printed sections of Tokyo on the map, circled in red as zones of high resistance. They were spread across the city haphazardly, threatening to break through into the financial district, the historical city, maybe even the Imperial Palace itself. It was the army's job to stop that - to restore order, to end the chaos, to save Japan.                                                                                     Akira looked into the crowd as he spoke, seeing the Prime Minister in the front row. The minister looked pleased, to Akira's amusement. He could picture the politicians dreaming of their next steps, looking forwards to rallies where they could proudly tout how they, and they alone, stopped the carnage that had swept the Sphere.

The army men had taken the opportunity to kick the Navy to the curb, leaving them only with the customary post of Navy Minister.                                                                                     Public order and subjugation to the military fiat had become the name of the game. The Yokusankai were given a choice: "get in line, or we will make you." The press, too, was not spared. From the Asahi or Mainichi all the way down to the village papers in places like Shōdoshima or Muroram, all of it was shuttered en masse by military directives. The NHK and other broadcasting corporations were also ruthlessly restricted, with even pre-coup propaganda works harshly scrutinized for potentially unpatriotic concepts.                                                                                     Japan had succumbed to paranoia in the worst way possible even while they purported to be making their way past it. With soldiers on every corner, the Empire was being forced to withdraw troops from Asia even as its satellites increasingly asserted themselves.                                                                                     The Emperor, observing all these goings-on and seeing a repeat of the era before the Second World War, shuddered and held his peace. Once more he successfully repressed the urge to speak, as he had virtually every single time his words could have made a difference in these matters. He could not repress the doubt that this era of military rule would be far less successful than the first.                                                                                                                                                                          .

jap.ev5 = "Happy New Year, Hayato-san." In the first days of January 1962, after the New Year's recess was over, Hayato and his colleagues now return to the Diet in the chilly mid-winter month. The Diet building seemed gloomy from a distance, and the grounds were wet with precipitation from the night before. Hayato's colleagues in the Taisei Yokusankai greeted him with relish, displaying great friendliness towards one another. Perhaps this year, Hayato thought to himself, everything would go smoothly.                                                                                     "Are you all right?"                                                                                     "Quite so."                                                                                     Prime Minister Funada Naka opened the first session of the Diet of the year, declaring that this year would be a year of continued prosperity for the Japanese people and that the Pan-Asianist ideology had gone one year closer to its realization. The Yokusankai's deputies sat divided. Hayato sat among the conservatives, right next to the reformists. Behind them were the Technocrats and Kidoites, backbenchers of the party. Everything was going well.                                                                                     Then, the yearly budget. The conservatives proposed to maintain the military and domestic allocations to be at the same level as the previous year. The reformists rose up in contention, demanding a cut-back towards the military. Incensed, the Technocrats stated that they cannot abandon the principle of the National Defense State, not at the height of the cold war. The Kidoites raised their hands: 1952. Then they bickered among one another, another brawl on the legislative floor.                                                                                     Hayato sighed. Here we go again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n.
jap.ev5.a = Welcome to Japan's house of cards

jap.ev1 = The scene is a nondescript office in the Kantei. It is four in the morning, and everyone is asleep except for Prime Minister Funada Naka and Japanese Provisional Ambassador to the United States, Tanzan Ishibashi. The two men have been in the office for seventy-two hours as of present, following the emergency radar contacts detected off Hawaii three days ago. Families all across Japan and the United States are glued to their seats. Those who aren't are already in their nuclear bunkers and hideouts. It was deemed so, until the telephone rang - it could only mean one thing.                                                                                                               The first ring echoes.                                                                                                            Then the second. In the silence, the heartbeats of both men are clearly audible.                                                                                            The third. Follow the protocol, Ishibashi. Follow the protocol.                                                                                            The fourth. Ishibashi picks up the phone. "Hello, Ambassador. It's President Richard Nixon on the line. We need to talk."                                                                                          At present, two carrier groups are staring each other down 40 kilometres east of Oahu. One wrong move, one provoked reaction, and it's the end of the world. Deep beneath the waves are nuclear submarines - the pinnacle of nuclear technology, able to end the entirety of Osaka or San Francisco in a single salvo. It's darkly humorous how the fate of the world hangs in the balance through the actions of two men, one of which is on the verge of collapsing after a three-day run of unceasing work. In his stilted, and weary English, Tanzan Ishibashi said the words that would change the course of history forever.

For the sake of our future, and yours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n.

jap.ev2 = The air was heavy with tension and crackling static. Across Japan's vast urban sprawls, in Manchuria's great industrial centers, all the way to the agrarian villages in Southern China, over a hundred million radios and TVs crackled to life. In the offices of Guangdong, large screens and loudspeakers buzzed as the crystalline notes of Kimigayo washed over all of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. A calm voice announced, in a dozen languages simultaneously, that a speech from His Excellency the Prime Minister of Japan would replace regular programming for the day.                                                                                     Those fortunate enough to have a screen in front of them watched as the last notes of the imperial anthem faded away and the red and white logo of the Co-Prosperity Sphere was replaced by the Prime Minister's office. Funada Naka, arguably one of the most powerful men in the whole world, sat behind a large and uncluttered desk in his ordered, and suitably magniloquent office. The Prime Minister had a most uncharacteristic expression of relief, mouth curved in a small, dignified smile. Over a billion people held their breath as he began speaking in the measured tone befitting his office.                                                                                     "People of Japan, honored allies, citizens and subjects of our Great Asian family, I come to you bearing news of a great victory. Not the one we are all used to, one of marching soldiers and rolling tanks, but no less great - a victory of peace." The Prime Minister pauses for a second.                                                                                     "As of yesterday, an official agreement exists, binding the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Organization of Free Nations to the mutual respect of their marine boundaries and security interests. The specter of nuclear war that has hung over us all in the last few weeks is dispelled..." The Prime Minister kept talking, but few listened after that. Roars of jubilation, silent thanks, and the myriad sounds of a billion lives returning to their normal rhythm after weeks of panic and uncertainty drowned out the Prime Minister's eloquium. For a brief moment, all of East Asia truly came together in celebration, and America with them, as President Nixon made a speech mirroring his Japanese counterpart.                                                                                     Of course, not all were happy. Some had wished for a war, some had pushed for a war, and for some the notion of ascending Japan negotiating with the moribund United States rankled deeply. Doubtlessly, such feelings find an echo on the other side of the Pacific as well. But for now, peace has prevailed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n.

jap.ev3 = On paper, the Sphere seems to be working like clockwork, bringing prosperity to all Asians and their allies in the Pacific, and to bind them all together in a harmonic network guided by Japan. Unlike the tyrannic shadow of the Einheitspakt, and the hypocrisy of the OFN, the Sphere stands to its true purpose: development and growth under Japanese benevolence - at least, when they toe the Japanese line.                                                                                     And yet, they can't hold on to it. The Philippine Republic barely can hold back the Communists descending from the North, and the stranded Americans in the South. There is also the eternal problem of Malaya, the gravest threat of all if the UMAJF manage to reach Shonan-to.                                                                                     Funada's telephone finally rings, and he dutifully attends, turning away from the windows of his office that showed the bustling activity from the streets of Tokyo.                                                                                                             "We've held the cities, but the jungle's on fire - Thailand is not helping either, they can barely reach the border without getting harassed by their own guerrillas." Yamamoto's grave, raspy voice came from the receiver, and Funada took a moment to ponder the situation.                                                                                     Malaya has long been a massive money sink, the repeated failures of the 25th Army constantly draining resources, as it was with Yulo's republic. Coupled with the rebellion on Mongolia, the cracks on the Sphere has been endured to exist for too long. It's time the opportunists remember why the Rising Sun shines brighter on the East, starting with the wayward Light of the South.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n.

jap.ev4 = Across the ocean lies the greatest threat to Japan's sovereignty and mastery of the Pacific - the United States of America. Humbled seventeen years ago through our superior command of the oceans, the once-indefatigable foe of Pan-Asianism lies slain - and our mark on them, the treaty ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles are daily reminders of such. The Tokumusoukan's branch in the West Coast, W Kikan have inserted their proxies well into the confines of American society, and have offered us an interesting insight into the attitudes of the Americans towards Japan.                                                                                     Richard Nixon's Republican-Democratic Coalition was an ideological and practical failure, but they still remain the voice of reason and moderation within American politics. Famously, Democratic President Dwight D. Eisenhower broached the peace on the Pacific by illegitimately allowing Hawaii's accession to the Union several years ago, as well as tearing up the Treaty of San Francisco. Though, W Kikan has determined that the Republican-Democratic establishment is the lesser of two evils, especially compared to their main electoral rivals.                                                                                     Far more dangerous is the National Progressive Pact, an unholy union of socialist agitators and their Southern allies united in the purpose of restoring American hegemony over the Pacific Ocean and risking war with the Japanese Empire. While relatively marginal in terms of electoral presence, W Kikan has determined that the NPP could rise to eminence over the next few years, a strong cause for concern as we would have to ensure our rightful territory in Hawaii and the Eastern Pacific is secure.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

 jap.ev.urajio.t = Urajio Brawl
 jap.ev.urajio = Recent reports of rioting in villages on the outskirts of Urajio have flocked in from news agencies following disagreements between settler inhabitants of Outer Manchuria and Russian natives. What began as a series of disputes over rights to land in the region has since escalated into violent outbursts of chaos that now ravage small sections of the countryside in a handful of towns just north of the city. Police are reporting details of 'revenge killings' against settler inhabitants, many of whom are Japanese citizens.                                                                                     The local garrisons have been requested by the Outer Manchurian authorities to help control and the local police commissioner has put out a statement, regarding the perpetrators as "No better than the anarchists of the north." These comments follow the uncovering of a particularly brutal scene in which elderly veterans of the Greater East Asia War had been murdered in the street.                                                                                     The recent violence and historic tensions between settlers and natives of Outer Manchuria can find its origins in issues of social and economic disparity, but local governments insist that the disputes are the fault of simple miscommunication gone wrong. However, many are skeptical of these statements, and defame them as methods to inoculate the Russians from blame in their own barbarism against the Japanese.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

brit_news_wallop = Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth has been appointed Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following the resignation of his predecessor Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket. A long-time friend and ally of former PM Barry Domvile before his assassination, Wallop's appointment represents a surprising resurgence of the declining conservative wing of the BPP - although there are rumours abound that indicate that the Lord Portsmouth may have his own designs for Britain.                                                                                     In his first speech, Wallop announced that he would lead a government "true to His Majesty The King," and that he would "heal the wounded spirit of the realm." How exactly the new Prime Minister intends to accomplish this is unclear, though sweeping reforms across all sectors of society are expected, along with a bullish stance against the German megacorporations in Britain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.

brit_new11 = Domvile breathed a sigh of relief as he entered his home. Ever since Adolf Hitler had died, it felt as if the cracks within the party had begun to burn out of control. The German garrison promised to stay and preserve order, whatever happens on the mainland. It felt like a thousand fires were lighting up all over Britain. Still, this was why he took the job of Prime Minister. He couldn't trust anyone else with this job, especially since the resistance seemed to be getting bolder. Damn them, damn them all! Didn't they understand that this was better for Britain? And what did they want to accomplish in its place? All this violence, for nothing more than the destruction of Britain.                                                                                     The very thought made him sick. But at the very least today, he could start to rest. And if nothing else, it seemed that Maxwell Knight was making progress on the resistance. Thank God for that, with the instability in Europe, it was more important than ever that Britain remain stable. He'd take the red box upstairs, he could read it there. At least he'd end the day with some good news after today. God almighty, he hoped would provide him with the strength to see this trial through.                                                                                     Butler on his own part had put on his sleep robes and a sleeping cap. And as he settled into bed, pushing away intrusive thoughts about the state of the country he-                                                                                     A terrifying roar rattled his bones as he fell out of bed. An instinctual primal fear as something so loud so close rattled his bones. What in God's name is- He stopped thinking and immediately walked downstairs and out of his apartment... Dear God. 10 Downing Street, Office of the Prime Minister, his neighbour's house was in flames. He could see the fires burning within the windows, their flames licking the outdoors. The policemen were frantic, calling for backup, for the fire department, and warning the government. The Chancellor could only look on as Britain's last hope for peace went up in flames.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ire_txt47 = In a comprehensive shake-up of the Irish political scene, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have seen enormous gains in the latest election, forming an inter-party government together as Fianna Fáil has been unseated after more than 30 years in power. Commentators lay this victory as the result of widespread anger at Fianna Fail's incompetence.                                                                                     Formerly the leader of Fianna Fail's liberal faction, Jack Lynch is now Taoiseach as he leads Fine Gael into power for the first time. Both parties' manifestos contain a laundry list of economic and social reforms, anti-terrorist action and a look towards the West. Many critics express doubt about how much of this ambitious agenda can be achieved, citing the conservative attitudes entrenched in Irish society and the coalition's ranks. Washington has congratulated Taoiseach Lynch on his victory while Germania has issued no comments on this recent turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n.

brit_new12 = In the the turmoil following Hitler's death, Britain has found itself sinking even further into a mire of instability. A bomb that had been covertly delivered to No. 10 Downing Street was set off last night, blowing up most of the building and killing several key members of government - most notably, Prime Minister Barry Domvile.                                                                                     In the following chaos, Ronald Nall-Cain has been sworn in as interim Prime Minister with the blessing of the German Government, pledging to "restore order" within the country. The identity of the bomber remains unknown. Many within the government, however, fear that they may have been in league with the Resistance, and that Domvile's assassination was only the first step of a wider insurgency.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

wrw_wrrf.1 = "Russia is a vast land, yet there is nowhere to retreat – Moscow is behind us!" That's what we said in 1941. Today, those words are nothing more than a bitter memory of the times when Syktyvkar wasn't the centre of the Soviet Union. The 40s were a dark time for the motherland. Starting with a costly victory against Finland and then the largest land invasion in history. Bukharin was caught unprepared, being sure that Germany won't violate the Zhdanov-Ribbentrop Pact while they were still at war with UK. What followed was retreat after retreat until Germany was at the gates of Moscow. Despite our best efforts, our capital fell and with it all hopes of victory. In the year that followed the Nazis achieved their goal of reaching the A-A line, cementing their victory. Bukharin's disastrous economic policies were blamed for the defeat and internal tensions were high. The disgraced Bukharin mysteriously disappeared one day. Speculations ranged anywhere from abduction to exile, but there was little time to investigate as his disappearance lead to a collapse of what little central authority remained in the Soviet Union.                                                                                     While many of the politicians fled to the safety of the Far East, the Red Army decided to take control in the West. It was under these circumstances that the West Russian Revolutionary Front was formed. The WRRF restored order to West Russia and later banded together with Stalin's realm in West Siberia and the Kazakh SSR, restoring some semblance of central authority to half of what remains of free Russia.                                                                                     Under Yegorov's leadership the Russians are no longer trying to desperately survive, but instead preparing to strike back.

Following a grueling victory in the Second World War - a victory paid for in blood and iron, the Empire of Japan stands triumphant in Asia, from the frigid waters of Sakhalin, to the bustling metropolis of Tokyo, to the far reaches of Calcutta and New Guinea.                                                                                                                                        On the surface, Japan has everything it could have ever wanted in 1962. The Zaibatsu champion Asia's economic growth at breakneck speed. The Imperial Japanese Navy is the most powerful maritime force in the world, from Tokyo Bay to San Francisco. The Imperial Japanese Army is the enforcer of Tokyo's will throughout most of Asia. Most prominently, it guards Japan's crown jewel, and a once-immutable enemy, China - now brought to heel. The politicians in Tokyo bicker, but the Taisei Yokusankai has stood strong for over twenty years, heralding a Shintaisei - a New Order over both Japan itself and Asia, led by the conservative Naka Funada.                                                                                                                                        However, deep beneath this seemingly perfect victory lies a bubbling cauldron of threats to the Empire's hegemony. In China and Southeast Asia, winds of dissent are brewing. The Imperial Japanese Army is overstretched - there's only so much ground one force can cover thoroughly. Across the Pacific, the United States seems poised to avenge their defeat nearly twenty years ago. Deep inside Japan itself, the labyrinthine structure of the state hides a deep rot of corruption and deceit, one that is slowly working its way to the surface, and could potentially threaten the very foundations of the Japanese Empire.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n.

wrw_css.csr = With the politburo continuing to be indecisive, the protestors grew bolder until today they marched on the politburo demanding an end to the regime. After the local garrison refused to open fire, the politburo found themselves trapped in a building surrounded by a mob. After a few hours they agreed to negotiate with the protest leaders, the end result of which handing over power in return for the party members being escorted to the Presidium in the Far East.                                                                                     At the end of the day, Boris Pasternak proudly announced the return of democracy with the establishment of the Central Siberian Republic. With the WRRF and West Siberia being busy with the war, the Presidium has been the only one to condemn the revolution. It remains to be seen whether the Republic can survive in this harsh land.

wrw_csr.duma = It has been two months since the Central Siberian Republic was established. The basic foundations the republic have now been laid. With the formal establishment of a provisional duma, the Republic now has a functional government. Soon we will be start looking beyond our borders and decide what to do about the war which lead to the politburo's downfall in the first place.

ger.intro.t = Das Großgermanisches Reich
ger.intro = Over the course of the two most destructive wars in history, Germany lost everything only to gain the world. The Thousand Year Reich soared over the pathetic Allies of the Second World War, crushing resistance against its Führer's great ambition in both the west and east and marching its army farther than it ever had before. Although it came at a great cost - as all righteous wars do - even American resistance was ultimately halted in the wake of nuclear fire. Finally Germany had won, its honor restored and its destiny made manifest.                                                                                                                                        The Reich wasted no time following its victory. Immediately, it embarked on reshaping Europe into its own image - one of National Socialism, cleansed of the degenerate Bourgeois and freed from the grasp of the lowly Untermensch. Lebensraum in the East finally became achievable and was, alongside the Congo River Dam fuelled by the largest Slavery apparatus the world had ever seen, the German prestige project in the following years. The Heer became the largest and most powerful army in the world, protecting German ambitions from the British Isles to the Russian wastes and the Rainforests of Africa. Where once bitter infighting shed brothers' blood, there now stood the Einheitspakt guided by the Greater German Reich and its visionary leadership.                                                                                                                                        It did not take long for it all to crumble. In the span of less than a decade, the German economy practically evaporated, followed by the disgraceful West Russian War that brought the Reich to the brink of collapse, and the betrayal of the SS orchestrated by none other than the nefarious Heinrich Himmler. Had it not been for the quick and decisive actions of the Wehrmacht, the Reich would have collapsed. Still, the damage was done - the experiences of the 50's combined with rampant slavery and the reality of the world pressing down upon Germany has utterly destroyed the people's confidence in their government.                                                                                                                                        No longer is the Reich the proud hegemon of the world; it is now merely a shadow of itself, torn by shameless infighting, united only in fear for its future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n.

usa.intro.t = The Land of the Free
usa.intro = Years ago, before the talk of the Nazi jackboot and the Japanese tyranny of the isles, the Stars and Stripes flew high and mightily above the likeness of a different worldwide sickness: that of the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, the explosion of the Wall Street Crash, and the dread of the Great Depression that journeyed forth, wreaking havoc upon a crippled America. It was here that the ideas of a Rooseveltian New Deal burned, as comparisons to the failures of the Soviets' Nikolai Bukharin's own doings left the ideas unpopular and unsupported. And it was here that Al Smith came on top for the Democrats, allowing for then-incumbent President Herbert Hoover to maintain his stay in the White House.                                                                                                                                        With 1936, however, things changed for the United States, Joseph P. Kennedy promised an administration of balance and isolation, seeking to tip toe away from the breaking out of war in Europe by the Nazi, despite the constant pleas from allied states. Peace and abstention reigned in North America, allowing the country to maneuver a recovery from the Great Depression and bolster the American economy; however, calm and stability hath reigned not. For, on December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan, crippling the United States' fleet as it rested in Pearl Harbor.                                                                                                                                        With a navy on the retreat and a new President to take hold, President Harry S. Truman promised the American people that they would see the Beacon of Liberty push through for the cause of democracy, a promise which sunk to the depths of the Pacific on July 4th, 1945, as a flash of light consumed the island of Hawaii upon the dropping of an atomic bomb on the previously attacked Pearl Harbor. To make matters worse, late August saw the signing of the Akagi Accords, officially ending the war with the first great American defeat in history, as it signed away the state of Hawaii and the naval bases of Los Angeles and San Francisco to Japanese control, alongside endless amounts of reparations to pay and the lifting of embargoes to Axis-aligned states. The chaotic 1948 elections saw Thomas Dewey signed trump the embarrassed Democrats over a reeling nation, having to deal with the planting of seeds towards the new political paths of the United States. In the first post-war election, an angry and bitter American populace almost unanimously turned their backs upon the ruling Democratic Party.                                                                                                                                        Facing waves of defections to the Republicans and the loss of nearly all of their senate seats, the party desperately sought a way to survive. Ultimately, a radical solution was proposed by several former Democrats-turned-Republicans such as Senator Lyndon B. Johnson – a union with the now triumphant Republican Party. After much political wrangling, the two parties were united to form the Republican-Democratic Party, briefly turning America into a one-party state.                                                                                                                                        Thus, the legendary General Dwight D. Eisenhower, famed for his bold defense along the English line against the Nazis, won the election as the first President under the Republican-Democrats. Eisenhower worked hard in creating the Organization of Free Nations, an economic and defensive alliance of the democratic forces left within the world. However, with the final declaration of Eisenhower's intent to oversee Hawaii's reintroduction into the Union against the Akagi Accords, the United States has firmly entrenched its position in the dangerous world of today, whilst new, rising political stars come to sit in the most powerful seats of the country. Now, as we look forward into the 1960s, President Richard Milhous Nixon and Vice President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, son of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, find themselves at the helm of the White House.                                                                                                                                        However, the Republican-Democrats no longer remain unchallenged in the political arena. As the American Depression wore on and the matter of civil rights began to enter the public consciousness, some Americans began to turn to alternative voices to represent their grievances. The National Progressive Front formed by Henry A. Wallace and Glen Taylor in 1947 became a beacon of progressivism, while George S. Patton's Patriotic Party was established in 1951 to represent hard-line conservative interests. Both were able to carry states in the elections of 1952 and 1956, but neither could unseat the Republican-Democrats. In the interests of presenting a united anti-establishment voice, the two parties made the controversial decision to unite under one banner – the National Progressive Party – though whether this Frankenstein of a political movement can have an impact remains to be seen.                                                                                                                                        Where We're At Now:            In the year 1962, Richard Nixon is President of the United States of America. Fortunately, his work is cut out for him: Americans from coast to coast desire social reform at all levels. A new crisis is brewing in enemy-controlled Hawaii as the aggressive Japanese place nuclear missiles on the island chain. Racism runs rampant across the South as African Americans plead for the Civil Rights Act to be signed, while many white Southerners fiercely oppose the Act. The Cold War between us, Germany, and the Empire of Japan is starting to heat up once again, and it is President Nixon's job to bring his country to its rightful place on the world stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n.

ita.intro.t = The Italian Empire
ita.intro = How does one begin to describe the Italian Empire, birthplace of Fascism, conqueror of Jerusalem, hegemon of the Horn, lord of the Suez, the fourth world power? And how can one possibly describe Galeazzo Ciano, the man systematically tearing it all down?                                                                                                                                        The Second World War saw Italy transcend from Kingdom to Empire, conquering from lands British, French, Albanian, and Yugoslav alike - many wondered in those days how far Italy would rise under the gaze of Benito Mussolini. It seemed almost inevitable that it would grow to join the ranks of the burgeoning superpowers of the United States, Greater German Reich, and Empire of Japan. A fourth superpower, bound tightly in friendship to Germany, which would surely see the spread of Fascism world wide.                                                                                                                                        The fifties saw this dream of Mussolini's transform into a nightmare from which the country still has not yet fully woken. Strong Armed into aiding with the Atlantropa Project by Germany, Italy's coast was ravaged, and the adriatic destroyed, making way for nigh-useless salt plains. The economic crash that swept from Germany into Europe decimated Italy's struggling economy - and then, finally, when the Germans had the gall to attempt to drag Italy into a war against a resurgent Russia, Mussolini had decided Italy would no more suffer under German treachery. The Empire would withdraw from its alliance with Germany - and open its borders to those in the Reich that sought refuge. Political prisoners, escaped prisoners, and more fled to Italy.                                                                                                                                        As the fities wore on, Mussolini's decisions grew more erratic and unpredictable as the Duce aged. He moved against the King, Umberto II di Savoia, and very nearly plunged the country into civil war in an attempt to depose the monarchy. The only thing stopping him was his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano.                                                                                                                                        A devout Fascist, Ciano had nevertheless watched with growing horror as Mussolini's policies plunged the Empire into greater economic ruin and political strife. He stepped in between the King and the Duce's political rivalry, convincing his father-in-law to forfeit the struggle to end the monarchy; some say the Duce's death some days later was a mere coincidence, some say Ciano took the safety of Italy into his own hands. Whatever the case, il Duce was dead, and Ciano had risen to take his place.                                                                                                                                        The New Duce's immediately began to liberalize the Empire, not out of any dedication to Democracy, but out of sheer pragmatism. Fascism, at least the methods of it Mussolini had employed, had failed. Ciano's reforms walked back on racial laws, brutal colonial systems, and, perhaps most importantly, the suppression of Italian Democracy. Spurred on by King Umberto II, the Duce has slowly but surely began to reintroduce democratic systems to Italy's people, and even as the hardliners in the PNF bluster and grumble, the masses of Italy have begun to turn away from Fascism.                                                                                                                                        Yet this bloodless Revolution may yet fail. Carlo Scorza, the ad-hoc leader of the hardliners of the PNF, stands firmly against Ciano's reforms, blocking them when possible and causing public outcry when not. Italian Society has become polarized between these two opposites - the reform and liberalization of Ciano, or the hardline Fascism of Scorza. The tensions have reached their boiling point.                                                                                                                                        The Empire stands at a crossroads. Either Democracy will rise from the ashes as a Phoenix, brighter than ever before, or it will be stomped out into dust, never again to light Italy's way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.oil.crisis = Following the breakout of several conflicts in the Middle East and the death of Chairman Enrico Mattei, the stocks of ENI, Italy's most prominent oil company, have fallen immensely. Due to Italy's role as a major player in world trade, the panics have spread in waves across global markets, and the price of oil has shot up. Oil has played a crucial part in the global conflict between Germany, Japan and America, being the most valuable resource in transportation and warfare.

w.burgundy.nuke = The Swiss Seismological Service has issued a press release with worrying news. Last night, their HQ in Zürich noted a seismological event somewhere in the Burgundian Jura that lasted four seconds and reached 4.6 on the Richter scale. Due to the lack of aftershocks, they concluded that this is "not natural activity, but likely a man-made incident." Several Swiss radiologists have also reported a spike in airborne radiation equivalent to a mild nuclear meltdown... or an atomic airblast.                                                                                                                 Governments worldwide have arrived at one conclusion: the Burgundians have successfully tested a nuclear device, twice as strong as the one dropped on Pearl Harbor in 1945. With the shadow state remaining tight-lipped as ever, the news will likely never be confirmed. Still, it seems that [GetYear] will be remembered as a dark point in history: the year Burgundy ascended to the ranks of the nuclear powers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.franco.burgundian = As the situation within Europe rapidly develops as the German sphere free falls into total collapse, many have wondered what if any move the secretive 'black state' would make. With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.

While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.gcw.bormann.t = Bormann Wins the German Civil War
w.gcw.bormann = The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Martin Bormann emerging as the victor. Having enjoyed extensive support during the civil war, many expected Bormann's victory to be the most likely outcome of this terrible conflict. Standing before the Volkshalle today, the new Führer promised the German people a swift return to the former glory of the Reich, promising limited reform to ensure such a conflict never need occur again.                                                                                                                                        With the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and much of Europe still consumed by chaos however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Yet with the great politician leading them, many remain hopeful that Bormann truly will be able to return stability to the Reich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.gcw.goering.t = Göring Wins the German Civil War
w.gcw.goering = The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Hermann Göring emerging as the victor. With much of the Heer and the Luftwaffe siding with Göring during the war proving to have been crucial to his success, the new Führer personally thanked the Wehrmacht during a speech at the Volkshalle today.                                                                                                                                        With Göring publicly advocating militaristic policies before the war, many now fear how deep the influence of the military may grow, and how long it may be before Germany finds itself in a new war. Yet with the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy and a weary populace however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Whilst many may fear for the future however, many are now simply glad Göring's military might has brought peace today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.gcw.speer.t = Speer Wins the German Civil War
w.gcw.speer = The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Albert Speer emerging as the victor. Once thought to have had too little support both from the military and the wider population to pose any real threat in the war, Speer today spoke before the Volkshalle as Germany's new Führer to vow a new era for the Reich.                                                                                                                                        Whilst Speer has promised to make true on the economic and political reforms his supporters now expect to come, few suspect the next few months to be easy for the new Führer. Even should Speer be able to win over the German people and begin to heal the crippled nation, much of Europe remains consumed by a chaos many view Speer unfit to resolve. Yet with the country in ruins, many are thankful to at least have the Reich's great architect now in charge of rebuilding the nation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.gcw.heydrich.t = Heydrich Wins the German Civil War
w.gcw.heydrich = The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Reinhard Heydrich emerging as the victor. Widely disliked by the German populace, it has been the might of the SS which has won Heydrich the day. Speaking before the Volkshalle, the new Führer denounced the decadence which had corrupted Germany, and vowed to remove all hints of degeneracy from the Reich.                                                                                                                                        Whilst Heinrich Himmler has offered his warmest congratulations to Heydrich, the international response has been largely muted with deep concern for the future of Germany. With the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and a Europe still consumed by chaos, many now fear what the rule of the secretive fanatical organization will have in store for the future of the Reich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

w.hitler.dead = Tragedy has consumed Germany as the news spread first throughout the Reich and then the world. Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany and victor of the Second World War, has died. Whilst the Führer's declining health had been speculated about for some time, the news has nevertheless left Germany in a state of complete shock. The Reichstag has announced that three months of mourning shall be held, and that the Führer shall be buried beside his late wife, Eva Hitler, with dignitaries from around the world invited to the funeral.                                                                                                                                        While Germany mourns, internationally many are celebrating the death of the man held responsible for three decades of suffering throughout the world. Yet many international commentators fear what may now become of Germany, the Third Reich having already been embattled in a bitter power struggle over the rightful successor to the Führership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n.

ger.successor.t = Hitler Addresses the Nation
ger.successor = Today, the world watches as one of the most significant moments of the twentieth century prepares to take place. Almost a week after the Führer was shot in an attempted assassination believed to have been orchestrated by Japan, Hitler today appeared on national television. With the necessity for an appointed successor being exposed by the incident, following days of heated debate Hitler stood before the Reichstag to announce his choice. Four candidates have been speculated for days. Martin Bormann, expert politician and head of the party, is a staunch conservative and believed the most likely candidate. Also believed highly possible is the militarist Hermann Göring, the beloved uncle of the nation if Hitler is the father. Another name being put forth is Albert Speer, one of the Führer's closest friends, who has advocated for extensive reform within the Reich. Finally, some have even suggested that naming Reinhard Heydrich as his successor would allow for the hostility between Germany and the SS to finally come to an end. After a lengthy, sometimes incoherent speech during which the Führer spoke repeatedly about the strength of Germany, at times seeming to lose his train of thought, the Führer lifted a trembling hand and declared his chosen successor would be...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Martin Bormann. Considered the most likely choice, the decision has been welcomed by the moderate and conservative elements of Germany, although the liberals and some elements of the military have expressed concern. With Bormann's commitment to staying the course of Nazism with only minor reform, Albert Speer, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich have criticised the choice as being certain to drive the Reich into an early grave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Hermann Göring. One of the Führer's oldest allies and beloved uncle of the nation, Göring enjoys extensive support from the Nazi old guard and the Wehrmacht, a relationship which has caused many to reject the decision. Albert Speer, Martin Bormann and Reinhard Heydrich have all criticized the nomination, vowing to never allow the Reich to fall into the hands of a glory lusting warmonger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Albert Speer. A highly controversial choice, Speer enjoys the support from the left-leaning members of the Reichstag and the liberal movement in Germany due to his advocacy of extensive economic and political reform. The decision has upset the more conservative elements within the Reich however, with Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich each denouncing the choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.ger.suc.heydrich.t = Hitler Names Heydrich His Successor
w.ger.suc.heydrich = Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Tokumusoukan agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognize the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Reinhard Heydrich. Shock and outrage immediately consumed the Reichstag, with a quarter of the votes going against the nomination, and another quarter abstaining, the first non unanimous vote in its history. While some hail this as an end to hostilities between Germany and the SS, only few are so forgiving, with most viewing Heydrich as little more than a puppet of Burgundy as riots erupt across Germany in response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.triumvirate.t = The Collapse of the Triumvirate
w.triumvirate =  In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the caudillos and the Turkish President have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over. Already Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to Cyprus and the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.ger.assassin.t = Assassin Strikes at Hitler!
w.ger.assassin = News from Germany is sporadic at best. Information smuggled out of Germania reports that shortly after celebrations over the Moon landing settled, military units and several platoons worth of bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. Apparently, an assassin, which the Germans claim belonged to the Japanese Tokumusoukan, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards. Already, reports of various other assassinations have surfaced. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as several units ordered each other to stand down and the chain of command fell apart. Suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. Can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.ger.moon.t = The Reich's Last Conquest
w.ger.moon = On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner became the first man to ever land on the Moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition. A grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich. While terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the Moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
w.ger.moon.d = Has the Space Race been won?

w.jap.meltdown = Pandemonium erupted in Tokyo today, as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department announced a wide range of arrests of executives across multiple zaibatsu on accusations ranging from fraud and bribery to murder and blackmail. An ongoing investigation into widespread embezzlement of state funds by the Minezaka trading company apparently expanded into a sweeping inquiry into corruption, with a particular focus on the Yasuda and Mitsubishi zaibatsu. Further indictments are expected, implicating senior Army and Navy officers and politicians across all of the YSK's major factions. The YSK appears entirely paralyzed and consumed by mutual recriminations at a moment where decisive government action is required to stave off a total collapse of the Japanese financial system, which would cause untold economic chaos across the Co-Prosperity Sphere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

w.jap.yasuda = Chaos gripped the Tokyo Stock Exchange today as the Nikkei index plunged by almost 40%, led by Yasuda Holdings the nerve center of the sprawling Yasuda zaibatsu. The tailspin came hours after the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department announced it arrested several Yasuda executives on accusations of fraud, bribery, and murder related to a separate probe of widespread embezzlement of state funds by the Minezaka trading company. Further indictments are expected, including against senior military officers and multiple politicians including several close to Prime Minister Punada Naka. Although the YSK is meeting behind closed doors over Funada's future, the investigation may paralyze the government just as decisive action is required to stop a potential collapse of the Yasuda zaibatsu which will have monumental effects across the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

usa_txt2 = The Republican-Democratic Coalition (RDC), also known as the Republican-Democrats, is a coalition of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, which forms one of the two major power blocs in the United States of America against the anti-establishment National Progressive Pact. The Coalition was formed in midst political upheaval inflicted by the formation of the Pact against the mainstream parties. At the end of the Eisenhower presidency in 1956, the Democratic Party didn't support Progressive Vice President Burton Wheeler, they nominated Estes Kefauver instead. Wheeler's split caused the revive of the Progressive Party and shift to the Nationalist Party. The participation of the dozen new parties during the midterms caused a chaos, sabotaging Kefauver's term. The Republican and Democratic party formed this coalition in response to the newly created NPP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

usa_txt3 = The National Progressive Pact (NPP), is a coalition of various political parties that makes up one of the two major power blocs in the United States of America against the establishment Republican Party and Democratic Party. The NPP suffers from a lack of unity on various issues such as civil rights. Political analysts claim that this may lead to a collapse of the party in the future. However, the NPP has unity on issues such as foreign policy and some progressive policies e.g. opposition to certain wars or conflicts and a militaristic approach to reclaim former U.S. lands for the former and welfare for the latter. Namely, these lands are the territories lost to Japan after World War II. These territories include Hawaii, various Pacific islands and the treaty ports in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Most members of the party both have a strong national distaste for both Japan and Germany. Despite this, the party is more concerned with Japan due to their aforementioned occupation of former U.S. lands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

usa_txt4 = The Civil Rights movement is reaching its crescendo. All across America there are protests, rallies, and riots hosted by Civil Rights activists, and they get worse by the month. Just this week, a massive march was held in Birmingham, Alabama, the heart of the segregationist south, with tens of thousands of activists, white and black alike, calling for equal rights. Although it started civil, local police chief Eugene 'Bull' Connor quickly deployed riot police and set dogs loose on the protesters. The peaceful march quickly turned into a running battle in the streets between police and activists. This event has been widely televised across the nation, with average Americans shocked by the police brutality on display in Birmingham. Many of the more liberal news sources across the United States have likened the events in Alabama to those in Germany decades ago, citing police brutality and the suppression of activists to draw parallels with the Nazi regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

This failure has left much of the population angry and itching for revenge. As the 1960s begin, the American political elite under President Nixon leads the world's largest remaining democratic power in the containment of German Fascism and Japanese Imperialism, while growing internal divisions over Civil Rights sees antiestablishment politicians rise under the National Progressive Pact umbrella; defeated yet powerful, united yet divided, America stubbornly stands in an era of cold uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

After the recent disgrace and resignation of President Nixon and the sudden and disturbing muder of his successor, the US is in a state of shock and there is a great feeling of uncertainty and fear across the nation. With Speaker of the House John McCormack rushed to the White House to be inaugurated as President, few can claim to know what will come next, with the political scene as divided as ever, the NPP mobilizing to capitalize on the situation, and the American psyche left traumatized and directionless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

usa_txt17 = McCormack had never seen the Capitol in such chaos.                                                                                                                                        He didn't know if it was worse because he was seeing the ugliness and confusion behind the scenes for the first time, or if it was really just that bad. It was made all the worse by the fact that no one was actually sure if he was supposed to be filling the role of President at all.                                                                                                                                        He was the Speaker of the House, or rather, he had been. Now he was President, or Acting President, something no one was sure about, and this was only worsening the situation. Kennedy's cabinet was unsure if they should be coming to him for approvals, or continue on their own initiatives. He was sure the intelligence community, particularly the CIA and FBI, were not giving him full briefings for security reasons, and the military was taking a similar, if more neutral, approach.                                                                                                                                        The chain of command was shot to hell, and it was grinding everything to a halt or actively sabotaging what little was working. There were already debates on how legitimate any legislation he signed into law was—generously assuming he'd get that opportunity—and if the Supreme Court would have to intervene. There was no precedent for this scenario; the one thing no one had expected to happen, happened.                                                                                                                                        The sole saving grace in this entire fucked situation was that the legislature had ratified the Twenty-Second Amendement - and now all of the states were scrambling to hold votes to ratify it and end the constitutional crisis. Even still, it would be months before this was done; months where the government would be stuck in this strange, uncertain limbo.                                                                                                                                        McCormack knew that some kind of status quo would emerge eventually—but it was going to be painful, difficult, and throughout it all he had to keep it from getting worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

usa.saw.t = Security Resolution 13
usa.saw = The atmosphere was nothing but on edge. Despite the chill of New York City, wind maneuvering between the skyscrapers as dirty snow lined the streets below, the OFN headquarters' interior was intense with heat. The lights above slowly burned the OFN delegations as they whispered among themselves, tensely waiting for orders on how to vote on Security Resolution 13. Then, Richard Nixon emerged, and all eyes locked on him. Taking his seat at the table, he prepared the papers in his hand, swallowing before speaking into the microphone. "Let me point out that this meeting helps unite our alliance and serves as a visible demonstration that the Organization of Free Nations remains behind her commitment to a free world," Nixon began. "We are the remaining free nations of the world. Our defeat and humiliation in World War II promoted recklessness in the councils of those powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest. And so, the defense of freedom is everybody's business—not just America's business." "We cannot stand aloof and leave the fate of South Africa to the Boer rebellion and Afrika-Schild. We must stand ready in the face of Nazi aggression. To pass Security Resolution 13 means that we finally have in sight the stand for freedom we have been seeking these past decades. Thank you." The delegations and spectators exchanged glances as the words set in and the room's anxiety subsided. An ear-blistering standing ovation followed. Nixon, too, felt his anxiety subside. The vote was unanimous—hell, even Brazil ratified the resolution. There wasn't a goddamn chance that the Nazis put down their arms and withdrew within 24 hours—perfect. Not even Herblock and every bastard at the Post or the Times could somehow spin it into a failure. If the Free World could make its stand, '64 would be a breeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

# The Wallace Presidency
usa_wal = The American people have chosen George Wallace as their new president, after one of the most contentious elections in US history. He has a number of plans for America with regards to creating a haven for foreign and domestic business as well as reforming education and welfare policy. Of course, the big issue, the one Wallace was truly elected on, is the Civil Rights Act. Wallace's victory proves that the American people are not happy with having such tyrannical policy forced upon them by the central government. He has promised that under his government, states will have full liberty to decide their own futures, unmolested by the demands of either Washington or of violent mobs. His presidency is sure to be beset by renewed outbursts of unrest from those who support the Act, but he has vowed to press on with his plans regardless of what some idiots who have nothing better to do but protest all day might do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# No More Interference! 
usa_wal_s1 = Throughout its years of dominance, the disgusting political chimera that is the R-D party had increasingly infracted on the foundations of this Union with its federalist politics, chief among them the shameful Civil Rights Act. While opponents will decry President Wallace as some ridiculous frothing racist, his real agenda is simply protecting the average American from any more government infringement upon his freedoms, something any reasonable person will agree with. And yes, that does include the freedom to keep the inferior races away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Win 'Em Over 
usa_wal_s2 = The National Progressive Party is founded on one great principle: America First. American interests come first in diplomacy, especially when it comes to reclaiming our stolen State, but the needs of American workers and families come first as well. Sure, some of them may be on the fence about our government thanks to the segregation issue, but we're going to show Americans across the country that they have no greater friend than President Wallace! President Wallace will expand his support base through two social welfare programmes: Medicare and Social Security. By giving workers across the country some federal support, he should be able to coast to victory again by grateful seniors and the newly-insured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# The Party's Plan
usa_wal_s3 = Like it or not, we're all in this together. The Center bloc of the party has supported Medicare and Social Security for a long, long time; they can take the lead on this issue. After all, this is about unifying the party, so we should let the party collectively chart our course. Wallace will cede the floor to the Center when it comes to these new bills. By letting the likes of Marine Neuberger and Scoop Jackson be the primary champions of the bills, Wallace will demonstrate that he is putting party ahead of ideology. By doing so, he will be able to reach out to Center politicians, northern Far-Rightists, and even a few Republicans to secure their votes or his legislation. Of course, just because the Center is leading the charge doesn't mean he can't slip a few of his own policies into these bills...
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Wallace Shall Lead the Way!
usa_wal_s4 = When will these namby pamby "progressives" get it through their heads that Wallace is their president? He won the primaries and the general fair and square, and if they don't want a good old Southern boy defining their doctrine then they can find another party! They're getting their Medicare, they're getting their Social Security, but they're getting those bills exactly the way President Wallace wants 'em written! President Wallace will make clear that this is his party by being the main champion of Social Security and Medicare. The NPP-FR will take center stage in policy advocacy and spread its own Dixiecrat message across the country in the process. The nation will see these bills as classic, down home Southern mutual aid just like the Kingfish proposed back in the day. This may alienate the Center, but can rally new voters from coast to coast to the Far-Right bloc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Pursue Social Security
usa_wal_s5 = We got a lot of old timers in this country who are still working into their twilight years. Who can blame 'em, when they got no savings to retire on? But this makes the job market that much harder for youth to break into. If we want to keep this economy going, we gotta get these geezers out of it; Social Security could be just the ticket... Wallace will begin drafting his Social Security package. By proving the NPP is a friend to the aged, this will boost their support among America's most frequent voters. There may be several opportunities to alter this bill to fit the interests of certain members of our Party as well...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Segregated Security
usa_wal_s5a = Social Security isn't just for retirees, it also includes unemployment benefits as well. Therein lies a problem. The Southern economy thrives on dirt cheap labor performed by Black hands. Millions of Blacks perform farm labor or domestic help for a pittance because they have no other options to feed themselves, especially if they lost their jobs elsewhere. But providing them with unemployment benefits and old age pensions could leave them with enough money to refuse taking low-wage agricultural and domestic work. This could throw the fragile Southern social and economic system into disarray. Thurmond wants us to guarantee that won't happen, and we have just the plan. We will exclude farm workers and domestic laborers from Social Security coverage. No work they perform shall entitle them to unemployment benefits or old age pensions, so they will have no freedom to quit their job on a whim and look for better ones. This will de facto segregate Social Security, since the overwhelming majority of those workers are Black. It'll shore up support among our Dixiecrat base, but horrify the Progressive wing of the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Our Northern Adjacents 
usa_wal_s5b = The Far-Right bloc has always had two wings: Thurmond's Dixiecrats and the old-school Pattonite neo-conservatives. The latter are far more business oriented so it may take a little convincing in order to get them behind Social Security, but for the sake of this bill we have to try. Wallace will meet with Northern NPP-FR leaders Margaret Chase Smith and Spiro Agnew to secure their support for the Social Security bill. By explaining its effects of getting the elderly to retire, he will show that it will enable more youth to enter the workforce and make enough money to drive consumer spending. With our entire bloc behind us, passing the bill should be easy peasy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Spend! Spend! Spend! 
usa_wal_s5c = You want a pension? You got a pension! You lost your job? You ain't losing your house! Wallace is your friend in Washington and he's here to bail you out of a jam. Name your price, and we'll foot the bill! Give me your poor, your tired, and your needy and we'll get 'em back on their feet! Wallace will offer incredibly generous entitlement payouts in his Social Security bill. The business-minded Far-Right leaders in the North will balk, but this strong bill will win us so many votes they can eat crow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Asses for Allies? 
usa_wal_s5d = Across the aisle, our closest counterparts are the Democratic wing of the R-D's. They're a mite more conservative than the liberal Republicans, but they generally understand the value of social welfare. We might be able to reach out to Goldwater and get him on board with our new legislation, all though the Buckley-ite Yankee will be a tough fella to convince. Alternatively, we could reach out to Bobby Kennedy and his more progressive Democrats. He despises us for our stance on the Civil Rights issue, but he's always been a friend of the working man. We're honestly surprised he hasn't defected to the Center Bloc by now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Towards Medicare 
usa_wal_s6 = Social Security will help get the elderly out of the workforce and stimulate economic mobility, but it's not enough on its own. Many employers provide health insurance, and a lot of seniors are afraid to lose their healthcare if they retire. Thus, the NPP is proposing we adopt a national Medicare plan that will provide retirees with health insurance. This new legislation will not only prove popular with retired voters, the largest voter group by far, but also with the Center Bloc of our party. If we can mollify them with Medicare, they might look the other way on Wallace's States Rights legislation...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Restrict Coverage 
usa_wal_s6a = Byrd and Thurmond are up in arms about the new Medicare law. They say that if Blacks start getting coverage under the program then hospitals will have every incentive to desegregate and accept their payment. Moreover, they're quite worried that Blacks will start quitting their low-paying jobs in the delicate Southern economy, knowing their medical needs will be taken care of by Uncle Sam. Wallace hardly needs to assure them that they have nothing to fear. We will add clauses to the Medicare law exempting retirees who were previously domestic and agricultural laborers from coverage. As these professions are overwhelmingly Black, this will dramatically reduce the number of Black patients hospitals could conceivably see, and also serve to keep those individuals in the cheap workforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# More, More, More 
usa_wal_s6b = You want healthcare? You got healthcare! Lower cost insurance for the elderly! Uninterrupted nursing home care for the chronically ill! Annual cost of living increases for benefits! No earning limitations for seniors! Disability benefits too! If you need health insurance then Doctor Wallace is in! We will greatly expand the benefits package offered by Medicare. Our budget will take a hit, and the Northern Far-Right Bloc will cry foul, but by God will the voters love it! This bill will build the momentum we need going into the next elections!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Encourage the Elephants 
usa_wal_s6c = Johnson was always ranting and raving about his so-called Great Society. Now, we ain't standing for any infringements on State sovereignty over their domestic issues, but his healthcare policies may dovetail well with our own. Maybe we could find an unlikely ally in the Grand Ol' Party. We will reach across the aisle for a meeting with LBJ and the liberal Republican leaders. We could offer to make Medicare a bipartisan bill, and hopefully secure their support when the bill reaches the Senate floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Get It Ready for Congress
usa_wal_s7 = Now that we've decided what we want Social Security to accomplish, it's time to prepare it for the Senate floor. We will formalize the particulars, shake hands, and get a final draft out of committee and into Congress. Depending on the actions taken previously, we may have secured or ruined our chances of getting it to Wallace's desk. There's still time to prepare in case we have any other changes to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Finalize the Act 
usa_wal_s8 = We are now in the process of completing the final draft of our Medicare bill. This bill, if passed, will hopefully ensure healthcare coverage for millions of less fortunate Americans. This bill is controversial among the Northern ranks of the Far-Right bloc, but has broad support amongst the South and the center. We can still make a few changes, if necessary, before sending it to the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# The Senate Votes! 
usa_wal_s9 = At long last, it's time for Medicare and Social Security to have their day on the Senate floor. Let the discourse, debate, and hopefully not filibusters begin! These new laws are critical to the unity of the National Progressive Party. They are humanitarian ventures that will cement our status as the Party of the little guy. They are the foundation upon which we will build our self-help initiatives. They are the populist credentials Wallace and his party will need in the next election. Hopefully he'll see these on his desk after the Senate vote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# The Beacon of Democracy, Freedom and Business 
usa_wal_e1 = America is the last great nation on Earth to preserve the ideals of freedom and democratic government. We owe our success in this regard to the mightiest economy mankind has ever assembled, forged and maintained by American banks and American industries. Free from the state's menacing grip, they had risen to great heights, earned greater profit year after year, until soon America surpassed, then utterly dwarfed, the Old World tyrants and their many inefficiencies. It cannot be said enough: Without its unflinching dedication to free markets and free enterprise, our nation will have been consigned to a footnote in the annals of history long ago. As a new President enters the White House, so too must America chart a new course for its economy. For thinking men such as you and I, there exists only one option: Promote American business, at home and abroad, whatever the cost. Only then, as American dollars and American businessmen travel from Washington to all four corners of the world, unimpeded, unburdened, will our nation be capable of continuing the fight for the ideals we so deeply cherish in the decades to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Foreign Business
usa_wal_e2 = Wiser men than I am have said that America's business is business. That no matter who you are, or where you came from, America always had its door open, ready to make a deal. Guns, cars, pig iron, bread, Playboys -- you name it, we have it, no questions asked. For the better part of two centuries that had been our state of affairs, selling the excess of our plenty to anyone and everyone who wanted it; because of that, we prospered and grew where others keeled over and fell. It died an ugly death when the Depression hit us all -- but most damning was that the Democrats buried it under tariff after tariff without a second thought... So to the American people I promise this: The good old days are coming back, and we will soon reap the riches that follow. And to all the free nations of the world I promise this: Our doors are always open, our bounty always free to purchase. Come on in with cash on hand, and let's make a deal!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Iberian Business
usa_wal_e3 = Among the Triumvirate, Iberia is easily the closest to the United States -- a chink in the otherwise firm grips Germany and Italy have on the markets of Europe. Easy access to American lines of credit helped keep the country's economy solvent (if barely) following the construction of the Gibraltar Dam and its repercussions. Additionally, recent tensions with its ostensible allies meant that Iberian businessmen were gradually shifting their eyes away from the inter-Mediterranean and towards the trans-Atlantic. Our economic advisors believe that now is the perfect time to expand the reach of American trade into Iberia and, consequently, Southern Europe. A trade agreement here, some words of encouragement there, and soon enough our companies will be making Iberian pesos hand over fist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Canadian Business
usa_wal_e4 = While business transactions with strangers work fine enough, business transactions with friends have the added benefit of lasting far longer -- and there is no better example of a friend to America than our neighbor Canada. We have always enjoyed warm trade relations with the Great White North, much to the displeasure of the late British Empire. Canadian oil and precious metals freely cross the longest shared land border on Earth on a regular basis, and in return American cars, heavy equipment, and foodstuffs are unloaded daily on the busy docks of Quebec, Toronto, and Vancouver. Ours is a relationship that spans a hundred years and hundreds of millions of dollars, ultimately contributing to the prosperity of everyone involved. Through increases in our exports to and imports from Canada, we can strengthen these ties enough to last for at least another generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Australasian Business
usa_wal_e5 = With the fall of China, French Indochina, and the Southeast Asian colonies, America's once-domineering sway over the most populous region on Earth came to an end. From Nanjing to Batavia, American investments -- trade agreements, loans, company shares, overseas branches -- were written off or dissolved against our will. Untold millions that lasted generations, testaments to our nation's economic and financial prowess, swept away by a horde of Japs in little more than four years. But Uncle Sam is far from out. Broken and bruised, yes, but never out. While Hong Kong kowtowed to Japanese Zaibatsus, Canberra closed an entire continent shut from them. While Japan's new puppets expelled our businesses and our businessmen, Sydney offered them safe harbor. While all of Asia turned to the yen, Australasia alone kept true to the dollar. Twelve million is a far cry from the one billion to whom we used to sell, but that number remained loyal customers when everyone else jumped ship. If we're to reestablish America's presence in the Asia-Pacific, fostering better trade relations with our ally down under is the best place to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Deregulate DC
usa_wal_e6 = Regulations, regulations, regulations. They come in many shapes and sizes, different names for different people. Liberals and pinkos call them "environmental protection" and "workers' rights"; Nazis call them "efficient redistribution of the Führer's money". But rational men see past the smoke and mirrors and find mountains of red tape, ready to choke the lights out of anyone who dares to found their own business, become their own masters. Like loyal mutts they follow the Feds wherever they go, ruining the lives of many an honest entrepreneur at home... and many an honest entrepreneur from abroad. See, right now America needs every last dollar it can get to survive the next decade. Dollars to build roads and bridges, dollars to pay our men and buy our guns, dollars to grow wheat in the Plains and feed the American people. Right outside our borders is a whole mountain of cash, ready to flow like manna straight into America's balance sheet, building all the roads, bridges, farms, and factories we want. All we need to do is to loosen up a little -- nothing too harmful, just some... minor readjustments... here and there -- and all that capital will be ours for the taking. Simple stuff, right? Glad you agree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# The Union Makes Us Strong!
usa_wal_e7 = Workers' unions, organizations protecting the average American worker from the overreaching acts and breaches of justice committed by American companies in times past. Many have come to support the mandates of such unions and their protections for the American worker, while large companies have come into conflict with such organizations time and time again. Although these companies are large forces in United States society, it is without question that the strength of the American blue-collar worker can come as a blazing force in American politics. Thus, it is the administration's duty, even if it may restrict the economy, to capitalize on the support of such unions in some form of legislation, as Southern workers will appreciate the concern given to them by the government, while liberal-minded R-D's will begin to appreciate our work. Some call unions a new revolution in social policy, some call them a restriction on the American market, but the administration likes to call them "votes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Welcome to America!
usa_wal_e8 = We've done it. The road was long, hard and winding, with dog-headed lefties and duplicitous friends hounding us from every God-forsaken corner -- but we've done it. From every corner of the world businessmen of every race and nation, every faith and creed, fly in the best planes they can charter to Washington, D.C. Day after day they stream to the Oval Office -- dignitaries, industrialists, magnates, princes, oil barons -- in droves bigger than the last, with the best suits they can order and the shiniest smiles they can muster, suitcases full of proposals and entreaties and promises to Uncle Sam. And with a few words, a few jokes, and a few handshakes, billions of cold, hard dollars enter the treasury in a single meeting. In a matter of weeks, these dollars will travel all over the country, sprouting up farms, roads, and factories wherever they're needed -- spreading America's wealth to her people wherever they go. The road was long, hard, and winding -- but through diligence and hard work, America is once again a bastion of freedom, democracy, and business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.


# The Dirty State of Schooling
usa_wal_s10 = The state the American education system has been brought to shows that not even the well-being of our children is sacred to the perfidious progressive. Overburdened with central Washington interventionism, their curricula and even administration distorted to the dictat of leftists social engineering. We need to tear this atrocious system down and replace it with a proper American one at once. For the sake of our children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Funding for Schools
usa_wal_s11 = The fact of the matter, upsetting as it may be to the parents and the educators, is that funding for public education is already bloated beyond control, and taking up millions that could be spent towards improving the economy. Remedies are not always pleasant, but the government must find a way to completely restructure how education is funded and cut out all the unneeded fat. By the time it's done, nobody will see any real damage to the school system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Lowered Funding for Black Schools
usa_wal_s12 = It is blatantly unfair that the government is taking vast amounts of money from hard working white Americans just to pour them into trying to educate lazy inner city black youths. This solution kills two birds with one stone - not only are we saving money, we will also be giving those blacks a good reminder of their proper place in this society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Cut Education Funds
usa_wal_s13 = If those goddamn progressives want things to be "non-discriminatory", we can give them non-discriminatory. Let's institute some big general education cuts, with a few subtle provisions so that they hit harder where we need them to of course, but nothing the left can attach their claws to. We are saving money one way or another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Enforce Segregated Funding
usa_wal_s14 = Funny tricks with basic budget cuts are clearly not enough. With some new guidelines the remaining school subsidies can be redistributed so that they reach schools with good enough results that we can know it will be used properly. And everybody knows what "better results" mean. The figures don't lie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# States' Own Salaries
usa_wal_s15 = Why do hell is the Federal government expected to give out cash for the salary of every single goddamn teacher in the country? Managing these kinds of day to day expenses is much better left to local state administration, they'll know much better how to spend it and how to get the money than some Washington pencil pusher. Not to mention, look at how much money the Federal Government can save on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# The States Can Pay in Full
usa_wal_s16 = While our previous funding reforms have already helped a lot, they were merely the first step to true education reform. As with the wages of teachers, so too should as much of the funding as possible be administered on that state level. Not only will this help our agenda of promoting every state as a unique and independent institution, it will also relieve a lot of burden from the Federal Budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Lower Subsidies to the States
usa_wal_s17 = Since a more localized administration is clearly far more efficient, there is no need to keep pouring as much federal money into schools as before. If a state feels the need to put in more money, they can get it out of their own funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Maintain Educational Subsidies
usa_wal_s18 = Some radical types within our party and even among the Democrats believe that we should devolve education funding to the states, thus giving them greater political and cultural autonomy. While this might sound enticing, radical social experimentation with our youngest is exactly the kind of thing the Wallace administration stands against. No radical reform is needed at this point, we cannot accept the risk coming from completely revamping school organization... or the giving up of control over how our children are educated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Schools Cost How Much?
usa_wal_s19 = Trips, training, labs, all sorts of expensive wasteful nonsense is being pushed to the top of the expenses list. The school's job is to get a bunch of whiny kids together in a room for a couple of hours and telling them how numbers work, how much money do you really need to do that? If the government is to give its valuable funds over to the education system, maybe for once it's the schools that should learn a little about managing finance. Some more cuts are in order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# A Foolproof Plan
usa_wal_s20 = We've tested the legal waters with some of those sneaky spending bill, now is the time to see what happens when we throw all subtlety out of the windows. A new Bill written by National Progressive stalwarts shall enter votes, representing the purest form of the pro segregation faction. Naturally a Bill this offensive will die in the water, but seeing the proceedings will let us gauge responses, and when time for the real Bill comes everybody will remember the alternative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Segregate Teachers' Pay
usa_wal_s21 = Having a more direct oversight over how school funds are dealt out gives the administration some interesting options. Blatantly forcing educational facilities to give lower wages to black teachers is a risky and radical move, but the symbolic value of such an act would be invaluable in showing who is in charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Look at This Spare Cash That I Just Found
usa_wal_s23 = One benefit from the Wallace administration's surgical focus on state driven education is that the exercise has rationalized a great deal of the education budget - perhaps not to the extent Wallace's most ardent states' rights supporters had crowed of, but enough to meaningfully impact America's fiscal metrics. It never hurts to have more cash, after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# American Education
usa_wal_s24 = Education is the cornerstone of America. A free public education for all people is a wonderful thing, and it lets America's best and brightest shine. That's exactly why we must keep good, all-American schools! Separate but equal is the law of the land, like it or not, and the Wallace administration will make sure that American kids get a square, American education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Put God Back in Schools!
usa_wal_s25 = Our predecessors have purged American schools of the two vital qualities that make them great: Segregation and the Christian faith. Brown v. Board, Engel v. Vitale, Abington School District v. Schempp, all these rulings by our Burgundy-bribed court have undermined our educational system and threatened our children's future. Our school-children may be divided by color but they are truly united in prayer! Today, God and America's children are going to return to their rightful place: Segregated school districts. President Wallace will embark on a speaking tour of Southern high schools. Alongside sympathetic Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell, Bob Jones Sr., Pat Robertson, and W. A. Criswell, Wallace will expound on the importance of Our Savior and our traditional domestic institutions to America's youth. He shall swear to them, upon Scripture itself, that he will protect the integrity of their schools and lead them to a bright future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# I Encourage You to Follow the Southern States
usa_wal_s26 = President Wallace believes in states' rights. A state should be able to make their own decisions, especially when it comes to an issue as important as segregation. That said, the southern model has proven itself time and time again as the most effective model for the American people. President Wallace encourages the states of this great union to adopt the system of separate but equal treatment in all regards, but most importantly, education. Are the children not our future?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

We have to make sure that schools are teaching the good, wholesome facts of American history, and none of that good-for-nothing, gray fascist propaganda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Segregate the Curricula
usa_wal_s28 = It may be time to take separate but equal to its logical conclusion. If we adopt a segregated curriculum, we'll make sure that every American is getting an education tailored to their... people. Essentially, we'll make sure the true-blue Americans are getting a solid education getting them ready to lead this great nation, while not wasting too much time on... uh... er.... more subservient Americans, if you understand me, sir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

They keep protesting the whole idea of segregated schools, and they're really making us look bad. We're gonna have to do something about these protesters at some point, before it gets too far out of hand.

# Who Do You Work For? Yourself!
usa_wal_s2t = Now that Social Security and Medicare are out of the way, Wallace can turn his attention back to defending freedom on the homefront. Specifically, his plans to overhaul the American welfare state and replace it with American welfare states. See, federal aid is federal tyranny; it comes with too many strings attached and became just another way for Washington to force the South to toe the liberal line. President Wallace is going to change that forever. Wallace will begin considering a revision of federal welfare laws to give states more control over how welfare funds are allocated. He could either retain some federal funding for state welfare while giving states more say over how it's spent, or he could cut the strings completely and let states fund their own welfare programs. The latter would be the purest economic expression of his defederalized vision, but may prove to be a bridge too far for rural white voters...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# Federal Aid
usa_wal_s2t = The ideals of state autonomy are important, of course, but we cannot let them be the be all end all of our policy. Sometimes the federal government simply has to have a hand in how they spend their money, to ensure everything is done properly and the rights of honest Americans are respected. It's not hypocrisy, just common sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
# States' Own Spending

#Scotland

scot1_txt = It seems that the Scottish National Party had won in Scotland, as the results had been announced late last night. After losing John MacCormick, who was the president of Scotland since the country's inception in the waning days of the Second World War and who passed away recently due to pneumonia, a snap election had been called. This was a result of the near-collapse of the SNP after an incident at MacCormick's funeral when some members of the SNP had been arrested for 'disturbance of the peace'. This victory has been applauded by the many democratic countries of the world. Led by Robert McIntyre, who served as the previous vice president under the MacCormick administration, so far it seems that the McIntyre administration is pledging closer ties to the OFN, and to protect Scottish sovereignty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .\n

scot2_txt = The Independent Labour Party has won the 1962 election in Scotland, stunning the country. Regarded as the foil to the juggernaut known as the SNP, it seems they have come out on top to lead the country. William Wolfe, the president-elect, was a former member of the SNP, before leaving on his own terms after labor disputes occurring between the party. After years of serving as the opposition to the SNP, a big tent party in Scotland, it seems they have finally won a remarkable victory worth celebrating. William Wolfe has already pledged that the country, by all means, will stay independent, quelling rumors that the party served as a British Unionist front. A large portion of the party advocates for expanded welfare and fair treatment of the English minority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .\n

scot3_txt = It was announced last evening that the Unionist Party had won in a stunning upset against the juggernaut party of the SNP and the smaller, but formidable party known as the ILP. To the many citizens of Scotland, this was quite the unexpected victory. It had been reported during Priscilla Buchan's, the president-elect's speech, there were officers from the Scottish constable force at Holyrood, making sure no issues would occur. It seemed that there was quite the protesting group that had assembled, along with counter-protesters proudly displaying the Union Jack flag. However, the unusually quiet Armed Forces of Scotland, led by Marshal Douglas Wimberley, have given a short message to Buchan before moving troops to the border immediately for an exercise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .\n

inc_rift = The election of Subhash Chandra Bose as the President of the INC was a controversial event within the INC as he had been elected despite being opposed by Gandhi and the rest of the old guard. While Gandhi is in favour of cooperation with UK through the war, Bose believes it to be an opportunity that should be taken advantage of. It seems that now the differences between the two factions are reaching a breaking point with the resignation of most of the Congress Working Committee in opposition to Bose leaving the INC unable to function until this issue is resolved.

Fodd prices have already been rising in the region since the war started due to the increased shipment of food to Britain and concerns are being raised that this policy may lead to famine despite assurances that only surplus rice will be confiscated under the policy. While the INC has issued objection to the policy and has launched protests, Subhash Chandra Bose, believing the actions to be inadequate has resigned from the party and has gone into hiding. While some are concerned about what he may be up to, most are focusing on the steadily advancing Japanese army.

Fodd prices have already been rising in the region since the war started due to the increased shipment of food to Britain and concerns are being raised that this policy may lead to famine despite assurances that only surplus rice will be confiscated under the policy. In response the INC, among other groups, staged protests denouncing the denial policies for placing draconian burdens on Bengali peasants. Regardless, it seems unlikely that the decision willl be reversed anytime soon as the Japanese army keeps advancing towards India.

qu_in_mo = Following the failure of the Cripps Mission to secure Indian support for the war effort. The All India Congress Committee has launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called "An Orderly British Withdrawal" from India. Almost the entire leadership of the INC was arrested within hours of Mahatma Gandhi's "Do or Die" speech. The movement has quickly taken a violent turn unlike the previous movements with reports of small scale uprisings and even a few parallel governments being set up fuelled by resentment towards the war taxes and the forced rice exports. However without a leadership to galvanize around it seems that the movement will be crushed and the British government wishes to keep talks of home rule till the war is over.
qu_in_mo.1 = We can't afford any more distractions in times of war

ev_ina = As a result of our campaign in South East Asia we have captured thousands of Indian PoWs. Last year discussions were held regarding creating an armed force out of PoWs willing to defect. However the unit had to be disbanded after disagreements between us and our Indian allies. However with Bose's arrival in Singapore the INA has been revived. Even many Indian expatriates in Malaya have volunteered to join. They have established the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind or the Provisional Government of Free India. With our continued advance through Burma and soon into India, the INA will be a useful tool to spread our Pan Asian alliance into India.

When the gunfire finally calmed down, tricolours were flying over the two cities. Riots broke out throughout Bengal which rebels took advantage of and the army was ordered to retreat till reinforcements could arrive. The British government suspects Japan of supplying the rebels and has authorized use of lethal force against supporters of the uprising.

wif1_txt = It was not quite the call Ambassador Miner had expected to hear today. The implications were concerning, as Jamaican Prime Minister Norman Manley laid out the situation developing in his country. "So to be clear," he said after Manley had finished explaining. "There is a push for independence."."Correct," Manley answered. "The usual suspects. Bustamonte, obviously." Miner grunted. The Jamaican Labour Party was a consistent irritant and thorn in the side of both Manley and the West Indies Federation and Alexander Bustamonte was the driving force. A persistent, relentless, and unapologetic anti-colonist who used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his agenda. "He's never been this aggressive before."."He's not had an opportunity like this before," Manley said. "The rewritten Federation constitution isn't exactly popular. It underrepresents and exploits us, so the common understanding goes. Some concerns are valid, for sure, but he's trying to turn it into something it isn't. Something bigger." "Certainly," Miner agreed, there was only one thing he was interested in right now. "Are you going to do it?" A pause on the other end of the line. "That's one reason I'm calling. I believe this referendum could be held and defeated easily. However, things are...unpredictable. The people may view it as weakness if I seemingly give in to Bustamonte demands." Another pause. "A victory would be ideal, and it would negate Bustamonte as a political problem. Technically, I do not have to entertain this at all - though if I refuse to hold it, it will be unpopular. I would need the support of the United States if I did this. Could I count on you, should that be decided?"                          \n.

wif2_txt = Shockwaves rippled across the international community as news of Jamaica voting to leave the West Indies Federation was announced. Despite opposition from Prime Minister Manley and substantial lobbying from the United States, it was not enough to sway the people into remaining in the Federation. Despite this defeat, the Prime Minister has vowed to abide by the will of the people. Alexander Bustamante of the Jamaican Labor Party, and primary proponent of the referendum, has hailed this as a great victory for the Jamaican people, stating that "Only we will determine our destiny!" Analysts question the future of the Federation, as Jamaica was the primary economy of the bloc, and consider it an ominous sign that the influence of the United States has been shown to be far weaker than expected.                                  \n.

The vote ensured the largest economic presence in the bloc would remain, and acted as a vote of confidence in the administration of Prime Minister Manley, a consistent and strong supporter of the Federation.

With the mandate of the people, the Prime Minister has elected to proceed with his planned constitutional rewrite. Despite it being the driving force behind the referendum, Prime Minister Manlay has stated that he considers the issue now resolved, and will proceed, promising Jamaicans that strengthening ties to the Federation will only lead to prosperity - While also permanently bringing the nation into the American sphere of influence                               \n.

To build a path forward, the charismatic Trinidadian has called for a dialogue with every remaining Federational Prime Minister in his very own capital, the Port of Spain. After a few introductions and welcoming speeches, Williams looked prepared to read out his own speech. "While Jamaica's exit from the Federation was unfortunate, we are not required to follow in their footsteps and dissolve the rest of the Federation. We are already a small country, but one I am proud of, and one I assure you can be led to prosperity. The Federational system has worked well for us in the past, but not well enough, so it seems." Williams took a quick breather, curtly glancing at the ambassador seated across from him. "So what I suggest is this; to rebuild the Federation as something new." He paused again. "These West Indies were created as a strange hybrid of post World War Two nation building and foreign intervention, and definitely were not created to work for the West Indies. I suggest a total overhaul from a federational system to a unitary state, with the capital centered right here, in the Port of Spain." The solution was a divisive one, at least in Robert's mind. Discussion had captured the room, mostly between the various prime ministers representing the various nations of the Caribbean. Most of them spoke of an infringement on their nation's rights, a fact of which Williams took notice of. "As a last note, and I do not intend for this to serve as blackmail, but if my proposal is rejected, I cannot be sure if I will be able to maintain Trinidad as part of the Federation. Mr Miner, perhaps you would like to weigh in on the issue?" If his comment would've added more discussion into the room, Robert would never know. The rest of the committee had fallen silent, and all eyes now looked to Robert. With a sigh, he brought the microphone towards himself.                                       \n.


wif5_txt = In the aftermath of negotiations following the Jamacian exit from the West Indies Federation, Trinidad and its charismatic Prime Minister Eric Williams have secured the West Indies' continued independence not as a federational state, but as a unitary state. With this deal, it seems the rivalry between the Trinidadian Prime Minister and the Federational Prime Minister, Grantley Adams, has been finally healed, and both are now working to draft a new constitution for the reformed state. While opposition from the "Little Eleven" has been noticeable as they see the change as the strangling of their respective states' liberties, most Caribbeans welcome Williams' new deal due to the defunct federation's inability to grow or develop. The effects of Jamaica's withdrawal from the federation have certainly been harsh, but a brighter future is now in                                \n.


wif6_txt = The Trinidadian state has decided to follow in Jamaica's footsteps and has since declared independence from the very same Federation. After Eric Williams' proposal to dissolve the Federation in favour for å unitary, Trinidad led state had seemingly fallen through with the other member states, it was decided that the only suitable course of action was to exit the Federation altogether. Whilst the decision was made to preserve Trinidad's economic and political integrity, Williams had reaffirmed that trading with the OFN will not cease and has also gone on to ensure OFN commitments are met. Despite reassurements of Grantley Adams, the writing on the wall seems hard to ignore for many Caribbeans.                   \n.
wif7_txt = The West Indies lies in chaos today, as Jamaica has seceeded from the Federation, following the refusal of the referendum called for by Labour party leader Alexander Bustamante, social unrest has exploded across the federation, with seperatists all across the Federation calling for it’s dismantling. In the chaos, Bustamante launched a coup against the Federation, which he used to rewrite the constitution, creating a clause for exit from the Federation whenever necessary. Bustamante then used this to secede Jamaica from the Federation altogether, declaring emergency powers over the Island nation. This has been a huge crack in the OFN, with Jamaica now bitterly opposed to the United States, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the Federation follows suit.                  \n.
wif8_txt =  With the effects of the oil crisis felt across the world, it has signalled the end especially for the Federation of the West Indies. It’s reformation into a unitary state, what was considered a fundamental change in the character of the union, instead of helping the Federation’s fragile stability, saw to it’s end. The unitary state saw nothing but chaos, as a ineffective government in Port of Spain could simply not hold together such a varied collection of peoples and cultures, leading to increased calls for independence from the subsequent states. Eric Williams for his part, pushed constantly for the maintenance of the Federation, but a Black power revolution led by socialist revoluntionary Makandal Daaga saw to the end of his presidency, with the newly independent Trinidad decrying American imperialism, it seems that the Federations hopes are dead and buried, alongside Williams career.                                           \n.

# English Civil War
engcw3_txt = Today shots have rang out across England that herald something far worse than the London uprising in the 50's, for the second time in history England is in a state of Civil War. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, an organisation containing the full spectrum of English political outsiders from communists to a handful of more independently minded fascists has declared a revolt against the Collaborationist Government of Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home. Speaking from HMMLR's headquarters its leader, former general Claude Auchinleck alongside famed communist rebel Bill Alexander and resistance fighter David Stirling have declared that England will be a free nation or they will die trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

# The Government Prevails In the English Civil War!
engk_txt10 = The HMMLR organisation has been reduced to bands of roving guerilla fighters after the loss of their last major urban centre. The Collaborationist Government of Alec Douglas-Home has declared the Second English Civil War to be over, and that those traitors captured will be dealt with as their actions demand. On the grander scheme, this is an unfortunate setback for the Organisation of Free Nations and an equally important victory for the Reich as now the Isles appear to be securely under the German thumb. Yet much of the fighting was done by Engishmen not Germans, and one wonders if the status quo is quite so stable as some believe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Harold MacMillan English Prime Minister
engkmacm_txt = After their victory in the English Civil War, the Royal Party's hold on the country seemed absolute. But their grip is not as tight as one would think, for the recent parliamentary elections saw Harold MacMillan's United England party take control of the House of Commons. MacMillan, along with the more optimistic MP Reginald Maudling, championed the Royal Party's reformist wing, though the two frequently butted heads over just how quickly England should transition to democracy. They led a defection to a new party, with Maudling as party leader and Macmillan as chairman, and the recent election has proven their popularity with the English people. While Maudling promises to free England and lead her back to democracy, but with the still-influential Macmillan looking over his shoulder, he may not go as far as others hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Reginald Maudling Appointed English Prime Minister - Margaret Thatcher Elected English Prime Minister
engkthat_txt = Margaret Thatcher first grabbed headlines in 1961, when she became the youngest female MP in the Kingdom of England upon her victory in her by-election. Now, she has set a new record: the first female prime minister. Following the recent victory in the general election, Royal Party members of the House of Commons voted to make Thatcher their party leader, thus making her prime minister. The leadership election's result was a shock to many familiar with parliamentary politics, who long thought Thatcher to be an outsider the Royal Party's inner circle always kept at arm's length. Naysayers within the party have largely been quelled by her choice to staff the cabinet with "old guard" MPs, the most prominent of which is R.A "Rab" Butler. The question of whether she leads her cabinet or her cabinet leads her, however, will remain to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Arthur Kenneth Chesterton Elected English Prime Minister
engkches_txt = Shockwaves ripple throughout the British Isles as Arthur Kenneth Chesterton was elected Prime Minister of England, in an election seen by many as a referendum on the previously ruling Royal Party. The devastation caused in the English Civil War, and the support of Chesterton's Blackshirts in it, were seen as contributing factors in his electoral victory. The face of the National Front, a far-right and previously fringe party known for harbouring fascist and national socialist sympathisers, Chesterton ran on a platform of British restoration, opposition to the elites of the Royal Party, and a return to world relevance. Protests have broken out in London, with the unions, moderates, and minorities expressing fears that Chesterton will seek to emulate German and Italian policies. Few know what England under Cheston will look like, but all know it will be an England unlike any before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#HMMLR Victory
hmmlrvic_txt = Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance have announced their triumph over the Collaborationist Government of Alec Douglas Home and the German Garrison of Cornwall. Sweeping across England from victory to victory under the leadership of Claude Auchinleck, Bill Alexander, and David Stirling, the Free English government intend to restore the democracy so cruelly ended by the Reich decades ago. Rumoured to be supported by the Organisation of Free Nations this represents an undeniable defeat for German interests in Northern Europe. Though whether the loose alliance of revolutionaries that made up HMMLR can work together in peacetime remains to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#David Stirling Elected English Prime Minister
engster1_txt = In a shocking landslide it was neither the legacy of the Labour Party or the Conservatives who claimed victory in the first free elections held since the end of WW2, but a dark horse. Archibald David Stirling, former SAS officer, freedom fighter and commander in the HMMLR movement was elected on a platform of harsher reparations on part of former members of the Collaborationist government and distaste for the radical proposed changes of the Socialist Labour Party. This completely unforeseen turn of events is already causing waves across the Atlantic, where the new Prime Minister's dislike of American reluctance to interfere in the Civil War is well known. But in a statement to the press, David Stirling assured all that whatever comes next, England would prevail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#George Jellicoe Elected English Prime Minister
engjel1_txt = It was under a conservative government that England fell to tyranny, and it is under a conservative government that England shall free herself. The National Democratic League has won England's first free election in years and its leader George Jellicoe is to take office as prime minister. Jellicoe followed his father by serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and later became a charismatic member of the old government's foreign ministry. He was recruited by Auchinlock, becoming HMMLRs main liaison to America; from there Jellicoe has risen to the leadership of the NDL. The NDL is an ideological motley, including anybody from Liberal Democrats to the Populist Right andabout anyone who wishes to restore the monarch and democracy, and hopes of coalescing these factions into a coherent political party are yet to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

# Harold Wilson Elected English Prime Minister
hnmlrwil_txt = The idea of socialism returning to England has long seemed preposterous, but sometimes, reality has a way of defying the odds. Elections, called after the old regime's defeat, saw the Socialist Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, taking the reins of power. Wilson has come to embody the compromise between moderate social democrats and militants left as a leading member of the Labour Underground. He proved crucial in bringing leftist support to HMMLR, and is still aided by the Left Resistance commander, Bill Alexander. The Wilson cabinet promises swooping reforms from the dissolution of the English monarchy to a rebuilding of a comprehensive welfare state. But with the viable split within the party festering by the day, the first Labour prime minister in over thirty years does not have an easy road ahead of him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Communist Coup in the Commonwealth of England
engbirch_txt = Five decades ago, the Bolsheviks of Russia overthrew a moderate socialist republic, with claims of reactionary infiltration, and enforced a one-party state. History repeats itself today in England as hardline members of the Socialist Labour Party launched a soft coup against Harold Wilson, forcing him out of the party leadership. The newly-appointed prime minister, Reginald Birch, has proclaimed a Socialist Republic of England. In a televised speech, he denounced "reactionary plotters" within the SLP, claiming that they "choked the flame of revolution and plunged the workers into darkness." The new government's goals include: massive industrialization, military expansion, and economic autarky. But with their ideology making them effectively a pariah to much of Europe, it is hard to imagine this new state standing on its own for long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Ireland
ire_txt1 - The Republic of Ireland, in the modern era, stands at one of its highest points in history. Ireland, a relatively new nation, only gained its independence twenty-five years ago, finally ridding itself from seemingly eternal English dominion in 1937. While Ireland was truly free, a sliver in the North had been kept under British control. Fortunately, with the collapse of the British Empire in the Second World War and Irish entry into the Axis Powers, Ireland was able to reassert control over Northern Ireland, officially unifying Ireland for the first time in its long history. Unfortunately, not all is well in the emerald isles. As of 1962, the ruling Fianna Fáil has increasingly resorted to authoritarianism to protect "Irish democracy". Not only that, but Ireland's northern acquisitions in the Second World War have increasingly grow more unstable with rapidly growing terrorism. The IRA grows more and more a threat to the unity of Ireland and, if handled incorrectly, might just deunify Ireland or even destroy it. Ireland, of course, is in a rather pleasant situation compared to their other compatriots in the British Isles, however its myriad of issues could easily spiral into a full-blown crisis which might forever change Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ire_txt5 = Seán Lemass massaged his nose with the rough skin of his thumb
and pointer finger, before rubbing the hand over his tired face and resting his chin upon his palm. "Alright, Imogen, I'm ready," he said with a sigh. What's the news?" His new secretary cleared her throat. The girl was a helpful sort, given this job because she was the niece of some MP or another who cashed in a favor. Seán Lemass had traded so many favors to keep the country together that he could no longer keep track of who owed who Anything. "Mister Taoiseach, the Northern Irish Constabulary reports that the militant organizations have increased their activity this week. The IRA has plastered the town with anti-German pamphlets, the Citizen Guard hare committed yet another arson attack in the protestant districts, the Ulster Volunteer Force has hospitalized two more constables the name of throwing out the Catholics." The girl looked to him expectantly, as though she thought a rousing speech was about to come from his mouth and a decisive order to be given to save the nation. Instead, he let out a long and ragged sigh. More trouble in the Special Zone? Imogen, there's ALWAYS more trouble in the Special Zone."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ire_txt6.5 = Shame of the Giant: Eamon De Valera has long held a dream close to his heart: a dream of a united Ireland, free from Anglo dominance. During World War Two, the then Taoiseach accepted a deal with the devil to make his dream come true; should the Republic of Ireland collaborate with the Nazi regime, the Germans would support them in an invasion of Ulster, which was just barely accomplished through the sheer amount of German manpower thrown at the emerald isle.Like all Faustian bargains, however, the price is rarely one worth paying. German megacorporations control vast sectors of the Irish economy, and countless paramilita es in Ulster threaten total revolt against Dublin. Fianna Fáil only holds on to power only through ruthless political suppression, press censorship, and imprisoning those who speak out too loudly against the regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ire_txt8 = Economic Crash: For months, we have been hearing rumors from Germania: rumors of the Fuhrer's ailing health, rumors of instability within the Reichstag. Now, it seems that the rumors have come to a head; Hitler is dead, his great Reich is in its death throes. Now, the various factions within the German government make war with each other in a desperate bid for power, leaving the remaining nations within the Einheitspakt, all made to dependent on the Reich in one sense or another, to fend themselves. Ireland's economy, like many of those in the Pakt, has only survived thus far on the backs of the German investors and megacorporations, both sources of revenue that have now dried up entirely due to the chaos of the German Civil War. Ireland stands alone for the first time in decades, and the economy has begun to flatline. Something must be done to stabilize the nation and fix the problem, and it must be done soon if we ever hope to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Terrorism: The Paramilitaries
Ireland has had a tumultunus history, one that has spawned many paramilitary and terrorist groups. The main three groups are the Ulster Volunteer Force, The Irish Republican Army and The Irish Citizen Guard The Ulster Volunteer Force is an Pro-British, Pro-Unionist, and Anti-Republican organisation which is the primary paramilitary for those who resist Irish "occupation of Northern Ireland". The Irish Republican Army is a radical leftist group who's main aim is to combat fascist and German influence in the country. The Irish Citizen Guard is a relatively new off-shoot of the IRA. However, its age has not stopped it from becoming or of the mare violently active groups in the country. These groups and the influence they hold must be considered as Ireland makes its decisions, as the wrong play by the Dail could send Ireland on a bloody road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ire_txt38 = Seán Lemass smiled at the cameras as his IRA and Ulster Volunteer Force counterparts did the same, grinning cheerfully in their seats at Stormont Pariament. Most would cynically assume that the smiles were forced, but Lemass knew, from the long back and forths as the agreement was drafted - that these two were quite genuinely happy to have salvaged something from the jaws of defeat. It was that knowledge tha: Lemass had leaned on when he ordered for there to be no abnormal m military presence within views of the cameras. There would be no violence - everyone wanted this agreement to some degree. With my signature, I trust that we are buildinga sovereign Ireland today, free of repugnant foreign infiuence," explained Seamus Twomey to the cameras, as he scrawled his signature on the document. And with the consent of the communities I represent," began Paisley stepping into Twomey's place at the document after he was finished, we sign this document to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the protestant communities and acknowledge that we are no more or less Irish than any man in Dublin" I have little to say," said Lemass when it was his turn. "Save that  Ireland is finaly whole. Perhaps the first time it has ever been.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ev_legion_bor1 = Bormann pursed his lips as he read through the report that had followed the recent outreach to the surviving Turkestan Legion. It did not paint a flattering picture. Veli Kayyum was by all standards, a drunk, indulgent, and incompetent leader who only retained his position because he had founded the Legion. Bormann could only feel disgust upon reading the description of the man, and could only imagine what it would be like to actually be in his presence. In retrospect, it was obvious why the Legion had failed. It seemed like a joke - They finally had a path into central Asia, but if they had to rely on men like Veli, he was frankly not sure it was worth it. The only positive was that Veli was too incompetent to turn on them. Muttering to himself, and in a foul mood, he turned another page in the report, and cocked an eyebrow as he read. Well, perhaps this wasn't a complete loss. The agent, perhaps seeing how incompetent Veli was, had taken the initiative to find replacements, as clearly not everyone was pleased with Veli's leadership. One such individual was one of the Legion Generals, a mercenary who went by the name of Korşirmat. He was the son of a Kokand chieftain of all things - and a man with a deep hatred for Russia and communism. He seemed reasonably competent, though it was noted that he might be unreliable. Men with ambition and desire for power could be utilized, and Korşirmat could be useful in that way. However, there was perhaps a better option. A man named Baymirza Hayit had been in the Legion almost since its founding, hated the leadership of Veli, and very notably was an enthusiastic Hitlerite - a surprise to be sure, but someone who would likely be the most reliable. Bormann found none of these options ideal - but they could only use what they had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

ev_legion_speer1 = Agent Bauch crossed the dusty mountain trails of Turkestan like a phantom, covered by the dead of night. Kayyum was still hours away - the agent worried he may not arrive by morning. Somewhere ahead was a distant rumbling sound, but the agent put it off. In his mind, there was no time for detours. Suddenly, the rumble turned to a roar. In a flash, a truck pulled out of some unseen alcove as a din of shouts and clamour came from every direction. A few teenagers jumped from the flatbed, pointing guns and hollering. From the looks of it, they were Kayyum's soldiers. Clad in an assortment of Wehrmacht armor and casual wear, the gang looked unprepared for a skirmish, let alone a battle. These men were only fit for one task - extortion. A soldier stepped out from the passenger seat. He seemed to be the oldest of the group, and the only one with full fatigues. "You thought you could sneak past us, boy? The Khan demands tribute." The agent was fairly certain that "the Khan" didn't know a thing about this band of ruffians - hopefully they respected Kayyum enough to not interrupt his crucial negotiations. "I have been sent from Germany to see Veli Kayyum Han. I have my papers here-" The leader pointed his pistol towards Agent Bauch's pocket with a stern glare. "If you aren't reaching for payment, it's not worth the trouble. Just pay up, or you're going to find yourself buried to the neck, blooded and beaten, just waiting for the sweet release of-" The agent scoffed. "Fine." He pulled out an ornate watch - meant as a gift to Kayyum, ironically - and threw it to the soldiers. "This enough?" The boys quickly surrounded the watch, mesmerized by its glean of its metals. "With that concluded, could you take me to the nearest city? I have further payment if you'll let me hitch a ride.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_legion_speer2 = Ostensibly, this was a business meeting, Agent Bauch continually reminded himself. It was his duty to the Abwehr to take this mission seriously. But staring at the face of Veli Kayyum Han, one single thought rang through his mind - he had never heard a man chew so loudly in his life. Perhaps Agent Bauch was just wrong. When Kayyum first brought the agent here, he claimed that this was a celebration "in honor of him, the Reich, and the Führer", which seemed to be the prelude to some greater discussion. Yet the two men sat meters apart, on either side of a massive circular table surrounded by hungry guests and covered in food and drink... and women, oddly. Until now, the agent had never been to a meeting with erotic dancers, and he hoped he would never again. Yet somehow, even through the crass hollering of his fellow guests, he could still hear Kayyum chewing! Dressed as a mock khan, Kayyum desperately grasped at everything at his great feast as he leered at the women before him, a seated display of greed. The only times he would stop to discuss German support were to gloat to his deputies and bask in dreams of German wealth, openly discussing his want to "get his hands on those fancy German cars". This meeting was going nowhere. Still, there were things to be learned at this event. A few men quietly sat amongst their men instead of joining in the Khan's activities, indifferent to Kayyum's vices. Each stood with a purpose, a vigor, and most importantly, a sense of independence. Perhaps there were other factors at play in the Legion than the Bacchus that sat across the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

 ev_legionk_speer = Agent Bauch sat in the room Kayyum had assigned him, quietly scribbling notes into his papers. With the practically medieval state of the Legion, their base was, of course, not electrified - the agent's only source of illumination was the flicker of a single candle. The time had come to review notes and select a candidate for Abweher backing, but given the state of affairs here, continued contact with headquarters would be difficult. This choice would have to be made here and now, with the ideal candidate sent to HQ to review. Korsimat was the most obvious choice. Compared to that brute Kayyum, he was composed and dignified, perhaps the only man in that building who appeared to value their work over their various indulgences. When the two had met, he was ignoring the party entirely, focused on explaining an attack set for the next morning. The fact he would attempt any real planning in that environment was admirable - that alone put him into consideration. His other admirable trait was his, well, jealousy. In their conversations, Korsimat spoke with grim frustration of the many times he had been passed over for the position of Marshal, which he clearly felt was his to take. This man's lust for power clearly came from a need for personal satisfaction, without plan or ideology, easily manipulatable by the Abwehr. And yet, the agent hesitated. The Abwehr knows its enemies, and this pomp, entitlement, sense of superiority - Agent Bauch had seen all of this in the West Russian War, one of the last times he had been forced to work with Wehrmacht dogs. Those generals, lusting for valor and glory, were easy to manipulate, but they often became hard to control. A man like that would never feel content as a puppet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_legionb_speer = With a heavy sigh, Agent Bauch crossed Korşirmat's name off of the list. After heavy consideration, the marshall simply wasn't trustworthy enough to be a suitable candidate for further RND support. In other words, the search would have to start over. It wasn't all bad news. There was one more option, picked as a contingency for if Korşirmat was taken out of consideration - Baymirza Hayit. Baymirza was the Legion's ideologue; at the party, he had proudly discussed his latest work, an unfinished paper on Turkic racial superiority. In explaining his ideology, Baymirza had shown a loyalty to fascism which would make him an easy ally to Germany and a hard ally to anyone else. His evident drive for control only made him more appealing - the ideologue wore his disdain for the central command on his sleeve, discussing a multitude of failings he clearly hoped to rectify. There was only one problem, one which had worried Bauch from the moment the two had met. Baymirza was... radical, much more than the Führer and Gehlen typically supported. The ideologue's theories were, at times, troubling - the kind of racialist diatribes which would have led to his removal back in Germany. Clearly, such an asset may not be appreciated within the RND. Ultimately, it was up to Agent Bauch. Even if it may lead to a stern reprimand from Gehlen, whatever choice he made here would be followed. Yet would it be wise to support a man who refuses to follow the positions of the Führer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_legionv_speer = Bleary and exhausted, Agent Bauch stared at the blank page in front of him, unable to write a word. Had it really come to this? Two candidates for leadership had been found, yet both proved woefully under the bar of the RND, not worthy of the immense effort such a coup may require. After hours of searching, it seemed that no one in this petty army was more fit to rule than... Veli Kayyum Han. Noisy, piggish, and lecherous Veli Kayyum Han. The agent stopped himself. Professionalism was a two-way street. Yes, the Turkbashy may not be the peak of dignity, nor even on the slope, but that did not stop him from being a valuable asset. In fact, it could make him a deeply valuable asset, easy to push any direction for the right coin. By its nature, the RND regularly relied on contacts with unsavory characters, and expected its agents to interact accordingly. Agent Bauch would make this work. He had to. Plus, the agent had collected so many notes on the habits of Kayyum. Why let it go to waste? The wick of the candle was at its final centimeters; surely the Sun would be up within the hour. Sighing, Agent Bauch grabbed his pen and began to draft a letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

april = To Break the Seal
ev_april = I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth. You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain... Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise! Dare the Lamb break the seal, and see what it be that the scroll conceals?

ev_pony1 = The frozen tundra of the Siberian north is a desolate place. It is cold, the deep, biting cold that you can feel in the marrow of your bones. It is a frozen landscape of endless white, broken up with frost covered trees jutting up like icicles as far as the eye can see. It is quiet; the birds do not sing here, and the animals that do reside within these ice blasted woods are dangerous hunters. Hearing them would be the last thing that you ever do. You don't know what compelled you to come out into these wastes. Was it a desire to escape your meaningless life? A more base desire, perhaps, one of seeking out water or food. Maybe you just decided to leave one day and never return. It is meaningless. Siberia called, and you deigned to answer. Regardless of your reasoning, you have been wandering for quite some time. You do not know where you are, or how long it has been. It has all melded together in your eyes, the landscape seemingly without end. You don't know how long it has been since your waterskin has gone dry, nor how long you've gone without a proper meal. Finally overwhelmed with the burdens of reality, you fall to the ground- wait. Wait, what the f- is that- Is that a pony??                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
 
ev_pony2 = Elena had descended from one layer of hell into another, from heresy to treachery. After long years working within Yagoda's administration, after years of building the institutions of Irkutsk into something that could restore the Soviet Union, she found herself seated near the man. She found herself at a round table with Yagoda, Sablin, and the beast Buckharin as the latter's assistant, as his expert on the dispute between the two men and a sign of his commitment to "interspecies collaboration." Death would have been too good a mercy for her, but maybe if this farce of a negotiation ended she would be rewarded with it anyway. "Come on, friends!" said the horse, banging its hooves on the wooden table. "I know we all have disagreements about who is and isn't a deviationist, but there's no reason for us to fight when we can talk about our differences instead! You've both been stellar comrades and I know we can all work as a team!" There was silence. Yagoda stared at Elena and the pony with a withering expression. Sablin buried his face in his hands and muttered something that sounded like "For God's fucking sake..." The creature Buckharin turned to her with its enormous eyes. It was impossible for those eyes to exist, for them not to immediately cave into themselves, but they bored into her nonetheless. "I'm starting to think that maybe friendship and Harmony isn't going to solve our problem here," he said in a loud, sing-song voice as if the two men weren't at the table. "What do you think?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
 
ev_pony3 = "It's bad enough to sit next to a traitor to the socialist cause," Yagoda spat, glaring at Sablin, "but the idea of listening and taking orders from a goddamn horse... I mean, God, the fucking absurdity. I feel like I'm in a goddamn storybook." Sablin let his hands slide from his face. His face was not that of a confident revolutionary but of an exhausted man trying to keep hold of the last strands of his sanity. "Genrikh and I have had our disagreements but, in this case, I have to agree. This is too much. This is..." He trailed off, shaking his head. "Is any of this real?" "Of course it's real!" Said Buckharin without an ounce of self-awareness. "If there's one thing I've learned over the last few months, it's that real strength isn't about a powerful security state," he gave a look to Yagoda, "or a return to true Marxist-Leninist principles," he gave a look to Sablin, "it's about working together to achieve great things! Isn't that right, Comrade Panova? You remember the First All-Ponies Congress, right?" Elena opened her mouth in a fish-like gape, only for Yagoda to suddenly rise from the table and remove a gun from his waistband. "That's it. I've had enough of this goddamn insanity. A fucking all-pony congress. I cannot... I refuse... I don't know what the fuck you are, but you aren't Nikolai Bukharin. You have five seconds to get out before I start firing." The other three members of the table backed away from the table, their hands and hooves raised. "Oh no, Elena!" said the cloying voice of Buckharin. "It looks like making friends with Comrade Yagoda is going to be a lot harder than we thought! What should we do?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_pony4 = Buckharin took a deep breath in and trotted forward the man with the gun. "Sometimes friendship is hard and it takes work to maintain them, but when we work together, it makes all the difference. Let me show you." Then, to everyone's bafflement, Nikolai Buckharin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, began to sing: "When I started out, I was unsure. I thought I knew all that I needed, didn't know what to expect But when my walls came down, I saw the truth All along something was missing And I think you'll see it too!" "Why the fuck are you-" Elena watched with horror as Sablin removed his hat and stepped away from the wall. Then, like a man possessed, he too began to sing: "This is where communism happens! This is how communism lives! Our movements weave together stronger The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer And the greatest anthem we'll know Is how the Magic of Communism grows!" From nowhere, there was now a swell of music. Sparkles and visions of strange worlds filled the air. Yagoda screamed, the gun quivering in his hand as he backed away from them, as Buckharin's magic seeped into his mind. Elena had a moment to react.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
 
ev_pony5 = In her mind, Elena was far away from this room, far from this scene. She watched as Sablin and Buckharin sang and danced about the value of friendship. She watched as the equine's song hooked into Yagoda's brain and the aging revolutionary joined them in a low, hoarse baritone. She watched them conduct complicated choreography and wordplay without preparation or explanation. As the music died, Comrade Yagoda turned to the horse and said in a voice unlike his own. "Thank you, comrade. I see now that, when we work together, we really can accomplish so much more." "I agree completely," said Sablin, wrapping an arm around his enemy, the man he'd vowed to destroy. His mouth seemed to move independent of his dull, glassy eyes. "We've learned that friendship isn't always easy. But there's no doubt it's worth fighting for." The beast pushed its way between the two men. It contorted its equine arms into an embrace. Its face shifted into a simulacrum of a smile. "I'm glad we could put aside our differences for Russia. We will unite our statelets together, beneath a common banner of Harmony. We will work together as friends and it's all thanks to the advice of my good friend-." She couldn't take any more. Elena turned from the scene and rushed away from the negotiation room. Guards looked at her in alarm as she passed, her hair wild and tears streaming down her face, but she didn't care. All she could think about was how Sablin and Yagoda had fallen to the horse's tricks. All she could think about was how larger and larger swathes of her motherland found itself beneath the sway of a talking, singing horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
 
ev_pony_chita = Mikhail sat on his surprisingly comfy prison cell bed, reciting under his breath the Russian speech he had planned during his brief imprisonment. If he was lucky, he might get out of here alive. Suddenly, one of the horse-things knocked on the cell's bars with their hoof, and said to Mikhail in heavily-accented English, "The General-Secretary is here to see you." Mikhail quickly stood to attention, as an equine figure approached him, and the cell door was opened. The unicorn these horses called their leader began to speak, "Mikhail Romanov. Your government has capitulated to the Union of Harmonious Socialist Republics-" Mikhail was quick to drop to his knees, begging for mercy, "Please sir, have mercy! I never wanted to rule Russia, I never even wanted to leave Australia! I just want to see-" Mikhail was quickly cut off by the unicorn hugging him, or at least Mikhail thought it was a hug. The unicorn spoke in a comforting tone as he embraced the former tsar, "Do not worry, Mikhail. We don't want to hurt you. I had in fact come to say that we were sending you back to your home in Australia." Mikhail could barely thank the unicorn for the news, he was blubbering so hard. He was finally going to see his family again, to return to his home again. Nothing could've made him happier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.
 
ev_pony_amur = Konstantin Rodzaevsky could hear little but the cheers of a crowd. Blindfolded, hands tied behind his back, it was all too clear what was about to happen. He should have been scared. Instead, he was simply lost. Ponies. He had been defeated by ponies. His conquerors were a lesser race, subhuman in every sense, yet they had destroyed his armies and conquered his nation. It was an impossibility. From the physical to the racial, his every logical thread had been left in tatters. A booming voice began to speak to his left. "While the ideology of Harmony does not condone execution, we were always prepared to make the rare exception. In the case of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, we have seen a pattern of cruelty and violence which unfortunately can see no reform. While controversial, we saw this as the only answer." The crowd exploded in applause. Suddenly, Rodzaevsky felt his body leave the floor, as if falling in reverse. Hoping to find solid ground, he began to squirm and kick at his restraints. All he managed to push off was the blindfold. As the cloth fell from his eyes, he finally saw the crowd. There must have been an army of thousands below him, some human, some ponies. The most powerful among them had beautiful horns, glowing with a magical power he would never come to possess. They were working together to lift him to the gallows. It was true harmony of the classes - the corporatist dream which he had always imagined, completed by an inhuman race. Then he felt it. A rope, tightening around his neck, shining with a powerful glow, and wrapping and twisting behind him. Finally, for just a moment, he felt true fear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_pony_green = Both the ideals of Harmony and Communism recognize the concept of greed as the driving force of suffering and the cause of those undeserving rising to power. The capitalistic state of Yakutia is no stranger to this, evident by reports of terrible working conditions by travellers, refugees, and our spies alike thanks to the clawing hands of the many oligarchs in control of the nation. It is unacceptable for us to lie here sitting while our comrades in arms suffer under the oppression of capitalism. Thus, it is our duty to liberate the workers from their shackles and bless them with the grace of Harmony.

ev_pony_brown = Konstantin Rodzaevsky is undoubtedly the vileist of the Harbin Three, adhering to an ideology so similar to Germany's National Socialism that it's almost indistinguishable. Him and his regime of fanatics are the true enemy of Harmony and the people. He must be eliminated at all costs.

ev_pony_blue = The State of Magadan is a corporatist state under the leadership of Mikhail Matkovsky, another promiment brekaway of the Harbin Three. Like the others, they wouldn't like the idea of Harmony, let alone Communism. Although he may be the more moderate compared to the others, he is no less of a threat. It is time to conquer Magadan, and make it truly free.What remains of the White Army and the old Tsarists in the East have rallied themselves under the rule of Tsar Mikhail II, setting up Chita as their base of operations. Make no mistake, these White Army remnants are hardline militarists hoping to undo our work back in 1917, Harmony and peace could never prevail. As is the case for all tyrants and enemies of Harmony, we will have to stamp them out for the sake of everyone involved. We cannot allow these reactionaries to condemn Russia to the oppression that we had suffered those many years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n.

ev_pony_recon = East of the Lake Baikal lies Valery Sablin's Buryat ASSR, a state born from a revolt against their former masters on the other side of the lake, what remains of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, led by Genrikh Yagoda.

We must stop this conflict and hope that we can unite to stand against tyranny, together.

#Speer
ev_speer1 = A figure often overlooked in the convoluted politics of the Reich, Albert Speer is nonetheless one of its key players. Architect by profession, and personal friend of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, Speer was attracted to the future Führer's persuasive dialectic and his great plans for Germany. The attraction was mutual: as soon as Hitler looked at Speer's work, the young architect found himself launched at the forefront of the party leadership, and tasked with designing dozens of public buildings.  The war changed everything. Speer was appointed Minister for the Armaments during the most difficult time of the conflict, and it was there that a side of his personality made itself even more evident: opportunism. He took the merit for Germany's production surge, but his main contribution to the war effort had been the invention of what would forever change the Reich: slavery. Hundreds of thousands of inferiors and war prisoners toiled and died in the military-industrial complexes, fuelling the German war machine with their lives.  After the war, Speer returned to his passion, and single-handedly designed the culmen of the Reich's grandeur. Germania, the new Caput Mundi, was set to overshadow Rome, Paris and all great cities around the world, but then the economy crashed, taking his dreams with it. In a moment of catharsis, he understood that slavery had been among the main reasons for the collapse, and in the most opportunistic of moves, he started speaking against it, asking for reform: as an unwanted consequence, he soon found himself the focal point of a large reformist movement advocating for change. Swept by currents stronger than him, he decided to follow them, desperately hoping that no one would ever discover his mistakes.  For good or for ill, Albert Speer has, in his own way, reshaped Germany, forever changing both its architectural fashion and its society. He is, and forever will be, the Reichsarchitekt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .

ev_speer2 = The economy has been on the downturn since the economic crash of the 50's. Many Germans who lost their jobs have remained un or under-employed and destitute for the better part of a decade now. Their only means of survival have hinged on the state continuing to provide them benefits. While the economy was crashing, many small business owners closed their doors for the last time. Major corporate interests throughout the country silently consolidated their holdings and bought properties, machinery, and expertise for next to nothing. German citizens were replaced with cheaper slave labor, and their jobs simply never returned. A decade later, wages still haven't returned to their pre-crash levels, even with ten years of inflation for the few that still work. The German people yearn for some kind of action; we can not be content to sit and watch our citizens suffer. Something must be done now to give the people some much needed relief and hope. Unfortunately, it is up to us to decide how to best approach this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 .

ev_speer3 = With the Führer's proclamation of Reichsminister Albert Speer as successor public opinion has been left divided, with many doubting Speer's abilities to govern whilst others are enthusiastic of potential change in the Reich. A highly controversial choice, Herr Speer has all but alienated himself from the upper echelons of the State through his strong advocation of reformist policies in the Reich designed to steer the troubled nation toward a possible prosperous future. Despite his close friendship with the Führer, this remains an uphill battle for the Architect of Germania.

ev_speer5 = The Master of Europe, harbinger of the New Order, one of the grandest nations on Earth - all this is fact. Yet Germany is not alone in this world. While the Bürgerkrieg is still fresh in our memories, Führer Speer realizes that time is not on the side of the Reich. No more of it shall be wasted tending to Germany's wounds while enemies outside begin making their moves against us. We must show our strength, rebuild connections and restore the Pakt to its former strength. It is time to act.

 ev_speer6 = The Fuhrer is the face of the state, yet in the halls of Germania his clique works towards a grand new future for the Reich - Kiesinger, Schmidt, Erhard and von Tresckow. Allies of Speer since his early days of campaigning in the 50’s, their combined talents will prove useful for the long due reform of Germany.  Though they may start making demands...!"

ev_speer7 = Despite the pretenders Bormann and Goring being soundly defeated in the Burgerkrieg, the Wehrmacht still largely distrusts our ability to lead Germany properly. In addition to this, troublesome elements such as Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schorner continue to spread anti-Speerite sentiment through our officer corps. If not dealt with soon, our regime could  be challenged by a rebellious Wehrmacht.
ev_speer7a = In the early 1940s, with our war industry unable to rally enough hands to maintain supply of new goods and equipment, we turned to the one resource we had in quantity that remained unspent: flesh. Millions of prisoners - Untermenschen, POWs, political enemies - occupied the concentration camps, being worked to death or starved to no end beyond extermination. As Armaments Minister, Albert Speer gave them a different fate entirely: to work, day and night and unto death, in the German war machine. Rather than breaking rocks and being tortured at the whim of SS guards, they would work the forges and assemble tools of death for the Wehrmacht. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Most men of fighting age were enlisted or conscripted to fight the plutocratic democracies of the West or the Bolshevik menace of the East. With women relegated to more appropriate roles, we were in desperate need for hands - any hands - in our factories. Without the mass employment of forced labor, we could not have produced the mountain of armaments that allowed us to crush our foes with an ease that no capitalist economy could have matched. Slave-forged tanks, guns and planes were as essential to our victory as strong German souls. However, slavery has grown completely out of control. No longer constrained by the state, our industrial leaders have developed a monopoly on the use of slavery, locking most of the German populace out of blue-collar jobs. Even agriculture has no room for free workers, as Prussian land magnates rent tens of thousands of slaves on the cheap from corporations like Reichswerke and IG Farben. For this plague on the Reich to end, the power of the megacorporations must be permanently broken and the deprived masses set free - no matter the cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

ev_speer9 = Gehlen has provided us with a list - a long one, and just the first of many. It wasn't surprising, of course, that the NSDAP is still packed to the gills with conservatives and militarists, and even a few SS sympathizers. What was surprising was the revelation of their boldness; Party men are, with a few exceptions, infamous for their cowardice and lack of imagination. This has been the case ever since we first took power and no longer had to worry about the electorate. We can largely pin this on the fact that the Party now exists solely to fill the rubber-stamp legislature that is the Reichstag, and as a career ladder for ambitious young bureaucrats. At least this list is more beneficial than concerning. The NSDAP has so far escaped thorough scrutiny in the Sondergericht compared to the bureaucrats - time to uproot the weeds from our garden. It would be too drastic and unpopular to simply purge the entire Party, but with concrete evidence of certain individuals' plans, who will question the removal of a few problematic elements?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

ev_speer11 = Helmut Schmidt, the Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs, has proposed a starkly different plan to that of his contemporaries in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Indeed, rather than suggest that the Groñgermanisches Reich conduct a full scale occupation of Poland, Schmidt has asserted that only through diplomacy and the perusement of compromise can a deal be effectively forged. Hm... it seems that Reichsministers's plan has been received with characteristic positivity by Fuhrer Speer... gut, sehr gut!

ev_speer13 = Even if our detractors in the Heer and the NSDAP thought of it as impossible, we have succeeded in bringing peace and the Reich's influence back to Poland with the power of the Pen and of the tong and with this have, for now, silenced the viper's nest, bringing a bit of breathing room for us and of calm for Germany.

ev_speer14 = Good news from Warsaw today. It seems that the Polish government has recognized its hopeless situation and, seeing no other alternative, has decided to give in. Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced. Speer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep. As he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it.

ev_speer18 = It is the decayed NSDAP, a true nest of vipers if ever there was one, that is responsible for Germany's moral failings. As our late Fuhrer became more engaged with winning the war and then entered semi-retirement, some members of the Party took the opportunity to enrich themselves and corrupt Germany at the expense of the people. Our great Reich would never have plummeted to such miserable depths if Speer, the sole bright light in the Party hierarchy, had been able to purge it of its worst members decades ago. Every conflict, every corrupt official, every abuse of power and crime against humanity - every single one, perpetrated by the NSDAP's criminal elements, despite Speer's best efforts.  That will be our line. Do not query it, do not query the Fuhrer, do not speak with ’insiders' or trust what you hear in the underground. Do not investigate - after all, don't you trust your Fuhrer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

ev_speer27 = And we thought we had it all. For the first time in decades, the Reich's future had seemed bright - the economy was on the up, civil strife was at a low, and the people's confidence in their government was unparalleled since the days of Hitler. It only takes a breeze to set the whole house of cards wobbling, however, and the winds of change are blowing.  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this Oil Crisis has hit us where it hurts - the economy. Sudden shortages have halted the flow of capital and material, and prices on the Frankfurt Stock Market have plummeted to levels unseen since the Fifties. We aren't the only nation left scrambling - fuel shortages mean international trade has become prohibitively expensive. If we want to drag ourselves out of this hole, it's going to be by our own efforts.

ev_speer28 = The Crisis is taking its toll. Countless businesses have closed their doors indefinitely, and the unemployed have started to fill the streets. Where only days ago Germans would have believed they were in the middle of a golden age, now they the government do something, anything to stop the spiralling situation. They demand work, food, aid for their families, something to show that the Reich has not returned to the disaster of the Fifties, or even the hell that was the Weimar Republic. The Reich's arteries have been cut, and its blood is spilling across Europe. It shows no sign of stopping.

ev_speer29 = A crash rose above the standard noise of the factory floor, and like the moment after a thunderclap, all went silent. The guard, who had been slowly making his way around the floor, perked up for a moment. It was not often that he got to punish a slave anymore- indeed, for the last few days, they had been more quiet than ever. He had not been the only one to notice this- the guards in the other wings had complained about the slowness of the last days just as much as he had. Of course, he was sure the executives who watched over it all didn't mind- less disturbances meant more productivity. Now, however, the guard had his chance to finally enjoy the power of his job. The other slaves seemed to part like a wave as he pushed his way through to the offender, an older man who the guard had seen- and punished- many times before. Splayed out across the floor lay the box of tools the slave had been using. A foolish error, and one that would not go unpunished, thought the guard. "Pick that up," stated the guard, pointing to a wrench that lay close to his feet. The man did not move. The guard smirked- a rebellious streak had always been apparent in this one. He resolved to teach him a few lessons in manners as he pulled out his baton. Quickly and forcefully, he pushed the man back with it, planting the tip squarely in the slave's sternum. "Pick it up, boy," the guard said again, louder and more threatening than before. Still, the man did not move. The guard responded by striking the man to the ground with a swing from the baton. Finally, the slave crawled over to the wrench and picked it up, standing as he did so. The guard smiled, his victory confirmed. His smile would remain on his face up until the slave, whirling around, slammed the wrench directly into his jaw. The guard collapsed to the ground, stars whirling around his vision. In a mix of anger and rage, he reached for his gun, raising it towards the rebellious ingrate. His shot went wild into the ceiling as a multitude of hands grabbed him, knocking him back to the floor and wrestling the pistol from his hands. Across the factory floor, the sounds of chaos replaced the previous silence, and the guard could only wonder how long the slaves had waited for this day before he lost consciousness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .

ev_speer30 = Out of nowhere, our administration has been completely blindsided by a slave uprising not seen in our Reich's history. Led by left wing students and revolutionaries, the Reichsbanner has torn a bloody gash down Eastern Europe, splitting the Reich in two.  On our side, the Gang and Speer enter into their final split on policy, the Gang pulling one way while the Fuhrer pulls the other. Helmut Schmidt, leading the charge to agree to the slave demands, clashes directly with Albert Speer's own call to accept only the bare minimum, nothing more, and force them back into the fold. The Reichstag cracks in confusion and chaos, and the Reich lies helpless to respond.  In the East, Ferdinand Schorner has committed his final betrayal, splitting from the Reich with the promise to march west, crush the slaves, and complete his return as a hero to Germany. If the revolt is not dealt with before his invasion begins, our plans are surely doomed.  This very well could be the moment that decides Speer's Reich. Whether he maintains control or not, this is an event that will ring through all of European history forevermore. It is crucial that we do not fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .

#Thailand

tha_txtev1 = With recent government purges gripping the attention of the nation, a more unexpected development has brought the Republic of Thailand to a standstill: the death of the Grand Marshal, Father of the Nation, Plaek Phibunsongkhram. From his involvement in the 1932 Revolution against royal absolutism, to leading Thailand to victory in war against the European imperialists, to the declaration of a Thai republic - Phibunsongkhram's legacy is perhaps the greatest in Thai history. His passing was announced to the nation by an interim governing council, consisting of various prominent bureaucrats and generals, now entrusted to manage the immediate fallout of the passing of Thailand's pater patriae. However, with power now resting in Bangkok's most cunning schemers, many now wonder how long until the balance of power tips, and violence swallows the young republic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev2 = With the situation spiraling in the fallout of Grand Marshal Phibunsongkhram's death, General Thanom Kittikachorn has launched a coup to seize power for himself in the chaos. Having established his presence within the military bureaucracy decades prior, a rush of armed detachments sprung to storm Bangkok's halls of power, and the General was sworn in as the new president of the republic. Among his first actions are calls for loyalty and patriotic fervor; thousands of troops march in the cities of the young republic, saluting the President Thanom as he watches over the nation with scheming eyes. However, as Thailand still licks her wounds, the world watches on as a new tyrant is born west of the Mekong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

His principled character, reputation, and charismatic leadership had won over the people and, despite rivalries within the service, support of many in the army. However, the situation remains delicate; Admiral Thawan's coalition of support is but a house of cards, only tacitly supported by military leadership. It is currently unknown how the new military administration will handle the current chaos in the young republic, and only time will tell if continued support for Admiral Thawan's government will last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

With loyalties established across the civilian administration and military bureaucracies, the new president's men have a firm grip over the rapidly stabilizing situation. President Chatichai's public appearances offer assurances of affluence and prosperity to the public, insisting that security and wealth will return under his leadership. However, his sweet promises are underscored by a shadowy rise in secret-police presence across the country, and observers are yet to be sure of the future of Thailand's domestic security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev5 = After three years of President Thawan Thamrongnawasawat's government presiding over the young republic, it has been announced that democratic elections are to be held, before Thawan steps down as president of the Republic of Thailand. His reformation of the Thai government's various ministries and pre-war institutions, now cut free from the abuse of opportunistic generals, is expected to finally be christened with the timely election of a new set of public officials. Although a shock to some, many comment that this is rather a natural conclusion to the years President Thawan's government has spent reshaping antiquated government institutions. Foreign observers anticipate the future of Thailand's recently-lit spark of democracy, now flickering and burning brighter in a land once tortured by autocracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev6 = In the first democratic election since the end of the Khana Ratsudon's grip over Thailand, it has been announced by the electoral commission that Pridi Banomyong's campaign for the presidency takes the victor's share, securing a majority in the National Assembly and on the ballot. Speaking publicly to the press and observers, Pridi states his intentions are to respect the newfound democratic constitution of the Republic of Thailand, and the wishes of its people. Many applaud Pridi's victorious campaign for his desire to defend the security and welfare of the Thai people, despite facing various challenges from both foreign and domestic enemies. Needless to say, international observers note that Pridi's successful election is but another crack in the Japanese sphere, as Thailand begins to turn its ear away from the empire dominating Asia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev7 = With the result duly called by the electoral commission in Bangkok, Seni Pramoj claims a victory in the National Assembly and thus has won the seat of the presidency. A descendant of the Chakri Dynasty, and member of the once-disgraced Seri Thai movement in exile, Seni's ascendancy was unexpected even by those paying close attention to Thailand's first free election. Such a radical departure from establishment politics in Bangkok prompts the world to sit and await not only the presidency of Seni Pramoj, but the very health and fate of the newfound Thai democracy under his leadership. What is certain, however, is that this rising democrat's administration is to forever shape the future of the young republic, and the future of those living within it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev8 = The crowded streets of Bangkok were plunged into chaos today, as agitated military presence challenging the civilian protests had opened fire upon the masses of demonstrators; foreign observers comment that the action may have been authorized by the president himself. A band of mutinying officers, compelled by scenes of civilian massacre and government tyranny, had struggled to depose of the governing authorities and were instead gunned-down as traitors by officers loyal to the regime, their dreams of peace and freedom dying with them. With defiance now made a bloody example of, General Thanom is likely to rule unabated as his reign of terror continues to scourge the young republic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev9 = The fires of outrage burn in Thailand as citizen demonstrations pack the streets of major cities of the young republic; they protest the cost of General Thanom's saber-rattling on living conditions and domestic security. That was until the challenged military presence had opened fire upon the crowds, cutting down hundreds in brutal mayhem - an action likely authorized by the president himself. The resulting bloodshed in the streets of Bangkok had compelled a group of mutinying officers to refuse commands, instead turning their guns to challenge higher command and the presidency. Observers report this disorganized chaos as a second coup in Thailand, yet no one can be sure of what may come of this armed struggle for power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tha_txtev10 = A severe tropical cyclone has struck southern Thailand, claiming approximately 700 lives and displacing tens of thousands in the region. The storm, named Harriet, first formed in the South China Sea, moving west on its ocean voyage. The storm then made landfall in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province on the south-eastern Thai coast, crossing the peninsula and entering the Indian Ocean. In Harriet's wake, hundreds are dead and tens of thousands have been made homeless. The storm struck at a difficult time for the Thai government, who had committed significant investments into the region as part of their economic development plans. As rescue and reconstruction efforts begin, many fear that the damage Harriet has inflicted will remain with Thailand for decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev11 = Merely a week after the death of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the National Assembly of Thailand has been targeted in a terrorist attack. During a session of the assembly at the Ananta Samakhom Parliament Hall, a bomb was detonated in the building, killing 10 civil servants. The President of the Assembly has formed a committee to investigate the attack, and has expressed concerns that this may have been politically motivated. Experts in the region have agreed with the President's assessment. The bombing had set back an already delayed attempt to confirm the next President of the Republic. It is unfortunately possible that opponents to the Assembly's preferred candidate may be delaying this decision by any means necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev12 = Following the recent passing of President Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the National Assembly of Thailand has nominated Sang Phathanothai, former advisor of the late Marshal, as caretaker President of the Republic. The President of the Assembly has confirmed that this is only a temporary decision, pending the forming of a new cabinet. Phathanothai is both a logical choice for caretaker and an outsider in mainstream Thai politics. He has served the previous President faithfully for years, despite his moderate ties to Thai trade unions that make him unpopular with right-wing elements of the Thai government. Sang enters a presidency with an uncertain future as dominant factions circle the temporary president, waiting for the moment he can be replaced with a more agreeable candidate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev13 = The election of Sang Phathanothai as caretaker president of Thailand was intended to be the first step in a peaceful resolution to the political turmoil and gridlock created by the death of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram. Unfortunately, this peaceful transition has not come to pass, as armed members of the Thai National Army surrounded the Thai Khu Fah building today and forced Phathanothai's resignation at gunpoint. Adding to this turmoil is general confusion from within the armed forces as to who should lead Thailand. Despite their united opposition against Phathanothai, it appears that the TNA were not immune to the factionalism that dominated the National Assembly. Guns once pointed at a single target now turn on each other, as Thailand braces itself for chaos and bloodshed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev14 = After a period of uncertainty and tension culminating in a failed military coup, Sang Phathanothai has been confirmed by the National Assembly. Formerly Thailand's caretaker president, Phathanothai now rules in his own right. In a public speech earlier today, Sang has promised Thailand that he will not only maintain the values of the late Marshal's reign, but usher in a new era of innovation and development, and promises never to "surrender to enemies of our nation, internal or external. Sang's confirmation as President is a shock to Thai politics. Many recall his house arrest on the orders of Sarit Thanarat, and even his close working relationship with the late Marshal Phibun did not suggest a future as Thailand's president. But the new President has defied those expectations, and intends to lead the country to new heights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev15 = Field Marshal and President of Thailand Thanom Kittikachorn has today been detained by dissident naval officers, sparking widespread chaos in Thailand. The incident began when President Thanom attended a ceremony at Ratchaworadit Pier, where armed and disgruntled naval officers surrounded the pier and kidnapped the president. Soldiers loyal to the government attempted to intercept the ship along the Chao Phraya River, while other dissidents rushed the city in an attempt to seize it for the captors. The situation has devolved into internecine fighting between loyalists and rebels within and around Bangkok. International observers familiar with Thai politics speculate that this kidnapping may be the opening round of a coup attempt, following rumours of discontent among the military under Thanom's controversial rule. The whereabouts of President Thanom and his captors is presently unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

After a lengthy battle, loyalists entered the would-be coup's flagship only to discover the President dead. While yet to be officially announced, it is suspected that President Thanom was killed in the fighting. In response, the Revolutionary Council hastily raised Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien to the office of President. In his inaugural speech, President Praphas denounced the coup, claiming this kidnapping to be the work of communist and Seri Thai agitators attempting to destabilise Thailand. Praphas' regime has ordered a widespread purge in the government of anyone suspected of aiding or sympathising with the coup. Militiamen and soldiers storm government buildings, arresting whomever crosses the new regime's path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev17 = Following the abduction of President Thanom Kittikachorn, a new government has emerged in Thailand under the self-declared Coup Council and its leader, former General and new President Kris Sivara. In a radio speech issued earlier today, President Kris has denounced both former president Thanom and Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien as despotic tyrants, vowing to restore stability and righteous governance to the Republic. While the end of this brutal regime has brought relief to many in Thailand, some question the stability of this new government. Kris' cabinet is composed of military officers and technocrats united only by their hatred of Thanom. With that uniting figure of hatred deposed, observers question the stability of the Coup Council's cabinet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev18 = President Kris Sivara of Thailand has resigned today, following a three-year term of power seized from the previous government. His successor, General Kriangsak Chammanan, has formed the first civilian cabinet since the 1950s, and has declared his intent to hold free elections "as soon as possible." Known to his colleagues as "P Kriang," the new president enjoys a certain level of popularity among the Thai people as a respected war hero. However, many question how much power the new president wields; his predecessor maintains influence over the government, and oligarchs continue to run the economy according to their wishes. Still, many Thai compare this government favourably to the oppression and chaos of the last two decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

In response to President Chatichai Choonhavan's deregulation of foreign companies, a series of attacks against Japanese and Chinese businesses have been reported across Thailand. While initially limited to individual incidents, anti-foreign tension exploded in a wave of destruction along Yaowarat Street, the main road of Bangkok's Chinatown. Thai nationalists and angry citizens attacked foreign stores, injuring dozens and destroying millions in property. Local press have already called this night the Second Battle of Yaowarat, in reference to a similarly destructive event on Yaowarat Street over a decade ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev20 = Following weeks of chaos on the streets and panic in the government, Thai President Chatichai Choonhavan has issued a flurry of proclamations: successful negotiation with anti-Sphere rioters, the reshuffling of his cabinet to remove the old guard from power - and, in a massive shock to Thai politics, the dissolution of the Khana Ratsadon. Further, President Chatichai has announced the future implementation of a new constitution and the founding of his own political party, the National Development Party, to contest in new elections to be held in the near future. These myriad changes have both excited and terrified many within Thailand. While many praise Chatichai for ushering in a new Thailand, others suggest that the President has issued these wide-sweeping changes with such speed that only he can properly react to them, allowing him to cement his rule over the nation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev21 = Tanks and soldiers marched on the streets of Bangkok today as President Chatichai Choonhavan declared martial law for all Thailand. Following failed negotiations with anti-Sphere rioters, the Thai military was mobilised to restore order, and opponents to Chatichai's decision within his cabinet were removed. His declaration has also seen the temporary suspension of the constitution, with Chatichai set to rule by decree for the foreseeable future. Not since the reign of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram has Thailand seen a state of autocratic rule. Some dissident historians in Thailand argue that Chatichai's centralisation of power is unparalleled even by the Siamese monarchy. As the regime continues to solidify their position against dissenting powers within government and the populace, many wonder what will become of Thailand under Chatichai's new dictatorship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev22 = Following the failure of Thai President Chatichai Choonhavan to negotiate with anti-Sphere rioters, the army seized control of the state. Martial law is in effect, and soldiers march onto Bangkok to suppress the ongoing riots. Further speculation has emerged from the Thai government that Chatichai's own position is no longer powerful, with his government now rolling back his economic deregulation policies, which some believe sparked the ongoing riots. Speculation on the true power behind the throne suggests that his Prime Minister, Pramarn Adireksarn, worked behind the scenes to ensure his alliance with the army and his control over the government. Many fear a return to the worst excesses of Marshal Phibun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

This morning, dissident military officers staged a coup against the Thai government, surrounding the Oriental Hotel and placing both military representatives and President Thawan under arrest. Some Seri Thai representatives escaped in the chaos, but many others were arrested as well; their fates are unknown. Admiral Sangad Chaloryu, ringleader of this coup, announced today that a military junta under his command has assumed control of the Thai state.

Once a former leader of the Khana Ratsadon, Pridi fell out of favour with Marshal Plaek Phibungsongkhram over the latter's dictatorial attitudes, sparking a long rivalry between the two that has culminated in this moment: Phibun out of power, Pridi leading Thailand. During his victory speech, Pridi reaffirmed his promise to implement radical economic reforms once outlined in the "Yellow Book dossier" he wrote in 1933. With a coalition of left-wing intellectuals and labour organisers at the foundation of his Sahachip Party, Pridi seeks to rekindle the spark of hope that once warmed the spirit of the Khana Ratsadon, and complete the task of 1932: the creation of a fair, free and prosperous Thailand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

Son of the noble Abhaiwongse house and former cabinet minister in Marshal Phibun's regime, Khuang emerged from the post-Thawan presidency as a voice for the past and future of the nation, and the people of Thailand have now voted him to lead them into a new era of prosperity. Khuang's Democrat Party, known locally as the Prachatipats, is a collection of regional politicians and aged aristocrats willing to enter a democratic system. Combining both the restoration of once-forgotten Thai values and sweeping, if measured, economic reforms, the Democrat Party sits in the middle of the political spectrum and reaches outwards. Veiled comments from the new president's victory speech suggest that even a referendum on restoring the monarchy is in Thailand's future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

As a representative of the more liberal elements of the Democrat Party, Lekha has vowed to maintain and expand the economic reforms set by the late President.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
tha_txtev32 = Following a turbulent period of democratic rule, Thailand has been placed under a military junta. In the early morning, armed forces loyal to the new strongman Admiral Sangad Chaloryu marched into a session of the National Assembly and arrested many MPs, including the former President. Speaking from the Thai-Khu-Fah Building, Admiral Sangad declared the coup to be a preventative measure against "ambitious and disloyal" elements from the civilian and military administration, singling out "leftist agitators threatening our nation." Reactionary militias have been mobilised to cement Sangad's control, though experts question if Sangad is truly in control, or if the high-profile members of right-wing think tanks that constitute his new cabinet are the true powers behind this new junta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

In the early morning, armed forces loyal to new strongman General Chalard Hiransiri marched into Ananta Samakhom during a session of the National Assembly, and arrested members of parliament along with the former President. Addressing the crowd of loyalists at the Assembly, General Chalard has declared an end to the previous regime's mismanagement and instability. Conspicuously absent among the MPs dragged out of Parliament were members of the Chart Thai Party, with whom Chalard has deep ties. As a representative of the Soi Ratchakru faction in the military, a clique affiliated with the old bureaucrats of the Khana Ratsadon, Chalard is expected to rule with a heavy hand as he purges the administration of disloyal bureaucrats and officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

The new coalition consists of politicians across all political parties within acceptable boundaries, and even some sections of the armed forces under Pridi loyalist General Net Khemayothin, united by their support of President Pridi in this turbulent time for Thailand. While some speculate that this consolidation of power was made in response to a possible military coup, and many argue that the sudden dictatorial attitude may doom Pridi's chances at success once free and fair elections are held, none can deny that President Pridi has emerged from Black February as Thailand's undisputed leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

A protege of left-wing Khana Ratsadon leader Pridi Banomyong, Supha has been swept into power on his promise of economic change resembling Pridi's Yellow Book dossier and the pursuit of social justice. As a leader, Supha is expected to represent the most acceptably left-wing forces in Thai politics: patriotic and progressive, promising radical economic reforms as a cure for the nation's ills. With widespread popular support and a cabinet of like-minded reformers, Supha's ambitions may change the face of Thailand forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

Formerly Governor of the Bank of Thailand, President Puey was elected on a platform of social security and improving the average quality of life for all citizens. Puey's ascension to the presidency has drawn criticism from right-wing sections of Thai society and military loyalists, who claim his opposition to security forces' handling of the Thammasat University raids betray a weakness and unwillingness to defend the nation. Nevertheless, Puey has been swept into power with widespread popular support, and has vowed to protect and promote Thai citizens, as his slogan goes, "from womb to tomb".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

A scion of the Pramoj noble family, Kukrit ascended to power on the strength of a political coalition between his Progressive Party and his brother Seni's Democrat Party. Kukrit's populist agenda has resonated with many voters in the countryside with his promises of expanding rural infrastructure, and has captured the interest of voters in the cities with his vow to raise the minimum wage. In addition to these material promises, Kukrit has also publicly promised to revisit the issue of monarchy - or lack thereof, as Kukrit and the Kao Na coalition plan for Rama VIII to return to the Thai throne.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.

Thammanoon was once Governor of Bangkok, and one of the loudest voices calling for a firm hand during the Bangkok standoff. In a speech outside the Thai-Khu-Fah before the first official cabinet meeting, President Thammanoon outlined the three major pillars of his administration: supporting urban traders and rural peasants, restoring law and order, and crushing communists.

vat_txtev1 = The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, eagerly anticipated since Pope John XXIII announced his intention to convene it in 1959, has finally opened in St. Peter's Basilica. Every bishop from across the globe is entitled to attend the Council and make their voices heard on numerous liturgical and procedural issues large and small. Given such a situation, spirited theological debate is not only to be expected, but seemingly encouraged by John XXIII's interest in updating the positions and methods of the Church for the modern age. Some conservative bishops have expressed concern that sweeping reforms are unwarranted at best and dangerous to the Church's mission at worst and will no doubt use their time at the Council to move things in a more moderate, or even fully reactionary direction in the face of their liberal peers. As things stand under John XXIII however, things seem to be heading in a decidedly reformist direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev2 = Today the Catholic Church mourns the passing of the Holy Father, Pope John XXIII. Born Giuseppe Roncalli, John XXIII was elected in 1958 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Pius XII Chosen by the College of Cardinals to act as a "stop-gap" Pope due to his advanced age at the time of his election, Roncalli quickly proved those expectations false. Although his Papacy only lasted for five years, John XXIII did much to inspire change. The Second Vatican Council, now in temporary suspension until a new Pope is chosen, was the defining act of a shockingly active reign. John XXIII was also known for his strong stance on human rights as outlined in his lauded encyclical "Pacem in terris" which pointedly condemned the actions of the German Reich against the Jews. John died beloved by millions of Catholics across the globe, and many already suggest that Canonization is only a matter of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev3 = After four years of debate, discussion, and study, the Second Vatican Council has finally come to a close. Begun under John XXIII as part of his push for an updating of the practices and doctrines of the Church, it has finished its task under his successor. It seems that the new pope was willing to honor his predecessor's grand vision for the council as the documents produced over the course of the extraordinary meeting have fundamentally altered the way that the Church shall interact with the world around it. In a significant departure from previous doctrine, the Church will now allow the Mass to be conducted in vernacular rather than strictly in Latin, a move that the change's supporters claim will significantly increase the appeal of Catholicism across the globe. It has also issued a strong condemnation against the German Reich's persecution of European Jews, marking a major departure from its tepid responses under Pius XII that had been heavily criticized by the liberal faction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Begun under John XXIII as part of his push for an "updating" of the practices and doctrines of the Church, it has finished its task under his successor. It seems that the new pope was not willing to push as far as his predecessor had wished, and while some major changes have been agreed upon, many liberal cardinals have left disappointed. Perhaps the most significant reform agreed to by the Council was the switch from Latin Mass to the Vernacular. At the same time, no consensus could be reached amongst the Cardinals as to what role the Church should play in the modern world, particularly in response to the atrocities committed by the German Reich that had previously been met with only uneven and tepid responses from the Vatican.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev5 = After four years of debate, discussion, and study, the Second Vatican Council has finally come to a close. Begun under John XXIII as part of his push for an "updating" of the practices and doctrines of the Church, it has come to a close under his successor. In a startling change of direction, the Council has rejected almost all of the modernizing proposals presented before it, taking steps back into more traditional Church doctrines and policies. The attempt to change the language of the Mass from Latin to the vernacular has been defeated by the traditionalists as has the effort to promote a more Eucemenist stance with regards to other Christian denominations. The Council has only ended up reinforcing the official line that Rome represents "the one true Church" and all others are, at best, misguided heretics. While traditionalists have praised the Council for adhering to long standing customs and doctrine in the face of misguided change, the Church's liberal wing has reiterated their fears that such stances only further isolate the Church from an ever-changing world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev6 = After three days of voting, the white smoke that heralds the election of a new Pope was spotted from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. The Cardinals have selected Patriarch Gregory Peter Aghajanian to lead the Church in the wake of John XXIII's death. The former Patriarch of Cilicia has announced that he will take the papal name of Gregory XVII. The new pope is expected to begin his term in earnest, his focus split between several issues dear to his heart. As an Armenian Catholic himself, Gregory XVII is expected to bring closer together the Roman Catholic Church and the several autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches. The new pope is also expected to take a strong moral stance against the persecution of minority groups across the globe, stating in his first public address as pope that, "Structures built on the foundation of hatred and evil cannot stand forever. They will always bring themselves to collapse one way or the other."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev7 = The Papal Conclave to replace the late John XXIII has ended with Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro elected as Pope John XXIV. A major leader in the Church's liberal wing, Lercaro's election suggests that the Church will maintain the reformist attitude begun under John XXIII's papacy. Even his choice of name is indicative of the new pope's interest in finishing the work begun by his predecessor. Aside from continuing the work of the Second Vatican Council, John XXIV has a greater agenda in mind. He has already begun speaking out against what he sees as an endemic "cultural colonialism" at play in the Church's interactions with its non-European members. This, John XXIV says, must come to an end if the Church is to become truly universal. Diplomatically, John XXIV has drawn public condemnations from both the German Reich and the Italian Empire while the nations of the OFN have expressed their warm congratulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev8 = The Papal Conclave has ended with Cardinal Giovanni Montini elected and taking the name of Paul VI. Montini has spent much of his clerical career close to the Vatican and maintained close relations with both Pius XII and John XXIII and made significant connections across the Church during his tenure in the Vatican Secretariat. Montini was known to be a relatively liberal cardinal, although not so much as to turn his moderate peers against his potential papacy. Paul VI will Hikely be concerned with balancing the many and disparate desires of various factions within the Church. Many still expect him to continue the work of John XXIII with Vatican II, although more conservative bishops are already preparing pushback against the most ambitious reforms with John XXIII no longer in place to push them. Shepherding the Church now falls to his successor, and it remains to be seen where Paul VI will take it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev9 = Cardinal Giuseppe Siri has been elected pope by the College of Cardinals in the wake of John XXIII's death. The conservative prelate was widely known to have been a leading contender in the 1958 Conclave and though in that election it was the liberal Roncalli who won out, it is now the time of the traditionalists to take the helm. Siri's disapproval of John XXIII's refromist goals even extended to Vatican I, andI while Pius XIII has pledged to reopen the suspended council, it is extremely doubtful that it will reach the same conclusions as it might have under John XIII or a more liberal successor. Congratulations have come in from states across the globe, including from Rome. Still, there are many liberal Catholics both lay and ecclesiastical who worry that important progress in the Church is about to be rolled back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev10 = The Vatican has announced that Pope Gregory XVII has passed away, once again leaving the Catholic Church at a crossroads. Since his election in 1963 to replace the late John XXIII, Gregory XVII took a strong moral stance in support of the oppressed across the globe. Naturally this ruffled more than a few feathers amongst the states he identified as carrying out oppression, but for millions of others he represented a powerful voice for their liberation. He also took significant steps to strengthen the ties between Rome and the various autonomous Catholic communities in the east. The Council of Cardinals will once again convene in the Sistine Chapel to elect a successor, but even as his work on Earth has come to its end, the legacy of Gregory XVII's ministry will doubtless reverberate in the years to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev12 = In the wake of Pope Gregory XVII's death, the College of Cardinals have convened to elect his successor. Today, the telltale white smoke signal from the Sistine Chapel announced to the world that they had made their choice. Sebastiano Baggio, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops. Baggio's influence within the Church had already been growing steadily since his appointment by Gregory as Prefect in 1965, leaving him with massive influence in shaping the next generation of Catholic bishops. During his short time as Cardinal and then as Prefect, Baggio did not wade into the factional politics of the Church within any particular zeal. At the same time, the trust Gregory XVII clearly placed in him as the clearing house for prospective bishops suggests he is no reactionary. Still, it seems as though this pope feels more at home dealing with matters of organization than of doctrine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev13 = The Council of Cardinals convened in the wake of Pope Gregory XVII's death has announced that Johannes Williebrands has been elected as his successor, taking the novel papal name of Lawrence. Having served as both the Archbishop of Utrecht and the Primate of the Netherlands since 1970, Willebrands has become famous within the Church for his promotion of Ecumenism, a movement seeking to reconcile the Roman Church with its estranged brothers. He took a leading role in the movement in the early 1960s and was president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity under his predecessor. The relationship between the German Reich and the Catholic Church has always been a mutable one and the election of a Dutch pope is sure to only complicate matters further. Germania has already issued warnings that any attempts by Lawrence to interfere in their affairs will not be tolerated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev14 = The College of Cardinals convened to choose a successor to the late Gregory XVII has finally announced its decision. In a result that has caught most observers and experts off-guard, it seems that the Cardinals have elected Corrado Ursi, the Archbishop of Naples, as the next Pontiff. The quiet Italian cardinal had been almost entirely overlooked during discussions of likely successors, with most papabile speculation focusing around more prominent figures in the clergy. Rumors have quickly begun to spread about the reasoning behind the College's decision. Perhaps the most prominent theory circulating is that Ursi's candidacy was initially put forward after the conservatives and several moderates came out in opposition to more liberal options. This resulted in several deadlocks that were only broken once Ursi was selected as a compromise candidate who would not rock the boat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
vat_txtev15 = Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger, Archbishop of Montreal and missionary, has been elected Pope Gregory XVIII and the new head of the Catholic Church. Since the Vatican II Council, Léger has been a strong supporter of the reforms of John XXIII and a leading member of the Church's liberal wing. Under Gregory XVII's papacy, the Quebecois cardinal sought to maintain the momentum that the Council had first begun. Gregory XVIII's earlier missionary work, particularly in Japan in the 1930s and across West Africa in the 1960s is believed by experts to foreshadow a greater interest in these regions that have under his papacy, alongside a continued cooperation with the Eastern Catholic communities begun under his predecessor. Canada has been foremost among the nations offering their congratulations, and while some Quebecois Catholics disapprove of Léger's liberalist bent, they are nonetheless excited to see one of their own in the Vatican.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

tur_txtnatspi1 = Failed German projects in the Mediterranean and along the Euphrates have seriously damaged our economy after a period of prosperity. To complicate the recovery, German and Italian companies are less and less willing to invest in Turkey, the former due to its ever-worsening political and economic situation, the latter due to our precarious alliance: reforms are needed, and quickly, or the Turkish economy might fall even harder should a crisis arise..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tur_txtnatspi2 = The Triumvirate is on its deathbed, and the "loving" relatives are mostly cheering for the agony to end. With relationships between Turkey and its former Italian ally at an all-times low, several nationalist politicians have resurrected the old Turkish claims to the Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes and Thessaly, in the hope of bolstering national morale - and their own popularity.
Despite this nationalistic revival, there are many who express worry, or outright fear, for the potential consequences of such claims. Italy is - after all - the most powerful country in the Mediterranean, and despite its overstretched forces, there is no guarantee that they won't find the strength to fight...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tur_txtnatspi3 = The Fifth and Sixth Inspectorates were government commissions tasked with extending Turkification policies to the lands acquired after the war, mainly the new provinces in the Caucasus and the Levant. Despite their efforts, they only managed to create more problems than they were actually able to solve: the Fifth Inspectorate simply deported Armenians and Kurds from the Caucasus to the Levant, while the Sixth was only able of replacing a colonial administration with a Turkish one, leaving rural areas de facto abandoned to themselves.
Now, unrest is rising across all newly-acquired provinces. Despite harsher and harsher methods - which are slowly turning even peaceful locals against the government - dissent and separatism are constantly growing, and the military police is unable to keep them under control: reforms are needed for something to change, and even then, it is not clear whether the change will be for good, or for worse...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tur_txtev1 = The Republican People's Party has ruled Turkey for 40 years. In the years following World War Two, the party was described as increasingly authoritarian as its grasp on power hardened. Dissenting members were expelled and Turkey's opposition suppressed in the name of national stability. Defeat in the War forced President İnönü to declare 'free' elections, which the CHP has now won. 40 years of ruling as sole representative of the Turkish people define the party's program, but also belief in reform. Younger members in the party hierarchy pledge to rectify the mistakes of the past 4 decades, but those that conform to the party line are doubtful. İnönü is excepted to deliver his inaugural address to a sizeable opposition for the first time - many of which convinced the CHP's victory did not come through anything like democracy at work. Will the CHP's victory bring more of the same to a country in need of change, or herald an age of reform?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tur_txtev2 = After a troublesome election period overshadowed by Turkey's defeat in the war, it appears that, through the ballot, the CHP's 40 year reign has come to an end. Behice Boran, a sociologist and one of Turkey's first female politicians, is the country's next President. At times imprisoned and suppressed by the CHP's authoritarian regime, Boran represents a generation robbed of their rights and liberties. As the leader of the DYP, Boran was nominated to the Presidency by consensus of democratic groups - the party is especially popular among the students, though it draws the ire of the establishment, both religious and secular. The DYP's rejection of the last forty years of politics would be unimaginable were it not for the unpopularity of the CHP following the defeat of the Italo-Turkish War. Whether a platform based around social progressivism will be enough to weather the tide of reaction ingrained into Turkey's politics is yet to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

With wealth inequality and other issues still rampant in Turkey, the party's great support among workers' unions and the urban poor appears to have secured their victory.

Of particular note is the disgruntled mood from the army, with many of its leaders seeing the AP's position as completely unacceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
tur_txtev11 = The 1971 Turkish elections have concluded, with the Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP, emerging victorious and leading the new government's coalition. A former part of the UDP's coalition, the MHP has since split off, rallying many nationalists with them. Much of the party's support appears to have come from orthodox nationalists that left the CHP after its realignment to a center-left position. The new president, Alparslan Türkeş, has promised independence from "foreign influences", as well as complete unity throughout Turkey. Türkeş repudiates differences between Turks and the minority populations of the Republic, instead claiming that all living within Turkey's borders are Turks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

tur_txtev12 = The Republican People's Party has ruled Turkey for 40 years. In the years following World War Two the party has been described as increasingly authoritarian, as its grasp on power hardened. Dissenting members were expelled and Turkey's opposition suppressed in the name of national stability. Now, with Turkey's victory in the war, any hope by the opposition parties of challenging the CHP's rule has been scattered, as President İnönü's popularity reaches an unprecedented height. The overwhelming victory of the CHP in the recent election has given the party near-undisputed control over the Grand National Assembly. Now, the only potential obstacle to the old guard's complete dominance over Turkish politics are reformers within the CHP. Yet with the vision of the party leadership's being seemingly vindicated, chances for the reformists to emerge victorious seem slim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Canada

can_txtev1 = After a bitterly fought election between the current minority Liberal Party government led by Lester Pearson and former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives, the people of Canada have spoken, re-electing the current party, and giving them a strong mandate for the next four years. The newly re-elected Pearson has a lot on his plate, making promises for a new constitution, healthcare, economic reforms, and trying to woo and satisfy the increasingly dissatisfied Quebecois and the alienated Western provinces to remain with the Confederation, and bring Peace, Order and Good Government from sea to sea to sea. The new government will have its work cut out for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev2 = In a comeback of the ages, former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker has managed to topple the minority Liberal government of Lester Pearson and return to power in the recent Canadian elections, winning a strong mandate for a four year term. After a short and divisive two year stint in power after replacing the ill George Drew as PM, until being defeated in late 1961 and relegated to Leader of the Opposition, the strong willed Diefenbaker is now back in 24 Sussex Drive. He is ready to complete the agenda that internal political rivalries and recession had robbed him of before, and this time he is prepared to make his mark on Canada forever: a new constitution, economic development in the Far North, and bridging the divide between Quebec and the West. It just remains to be seen if he will succeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev3 = The 1967 Canadian elections have concluded, this time with the Liberal Party of Canada managing to win a new term in power. However, this time it will be under a new leader: The young and hard-working former Minister of Justice John Turner, chosen to replace the recently retired Lester Pearson. The Progressive Conservatives were confined to the Opposition benches again, while the CCF and the Social Credit Party both made surprisingly strong runs for government. However, Turner and the Liberals have managed to overcome all three. At only 37 years of age, Turner is set to be the youngest Prime Minister in Canada's history, and he comes to power when his country is about to celebrate its Centennial. How the next century will treat Canada is anyone's guess, but Turner will be the face of the nation as they advance into the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev4 = Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker has won another term in the top job, to the dismay of his opponents on the other side of the aisle, in the halls of Washington, and even some members of his own party. Having managed to overcome the fractious split between the moderate Red Tories and the hardline Blue Tories that sank his first go as PM, Diefenbaker was able to win enough votes from the Canadian public to put him right back at 24 Sussex Drive. Even the spirited campaign by young Liberal leader John Turner, and the strong races by both the left-wing CCF and the rightist Social Credit Party wasn't enough to bring The Chief down. With Centennial on the horizon, it appears that Canada has chosen to go into her second century with a strong pair of hands on the helm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev5 = The Canadian people have voted, and they decided that the Progressive Conservative Party deserves another chance at power. This was despite the rather explosive and public feud between Prime Minister designate Robert Stanfield and his forcibly resigned predecessor, John Diefenbaker. The latter had been elbowed out of the party by a coalition of disgruntled party members of all stripes, with the popular Premier of Nova Scotia chosen to replace him. Despite this unceremonious departure, and the strong campaigns from the Liberals, the CCF and the Social Credit Party, the Progressive Conservatives have rallied around Stanfield, and are ready to govern the nation. With Canada's Centennial a few months away, it appears that the country is ready for the party whose history traces back to the first Prime Minister to lead them into the second century of Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev6 = The duopoly of power in Canada has been broken. For the first time in the nation's history, the democratic socialist CCF has managed to win the most seats in the House of Commons. Tommy Douglas, former premier of Saskatchewan, is now ready to take office as the Prime Minister. The friendly and charming Douglas has managed to convince the electorate to give him and the CCF, confined to third party status for its entire existence, a chance to govern the country. However, the result could also be seen as a general revolt against the failures of both the Tories and Liberals in the past few years to rectify the malaise that the nation finds itself in, and Social Credit was seen as too extreme. With Canada's centennial in July, it appears that the nation is ready to take a new course into the second century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
can_txtev7 = To everyone's shock, the Social Credit Party of Canada has managed to win not only the most seats but a commanding majority in the recent elections. Its leader, Réal Caouette, will soon be sworn in as Prime Minister, a turn of events that no one even a few weeks ago when the election was called would have considered possible. While the Liberals, Progressive Conservatives and even the CCF would have worked together to keep the Socreds out of power had they not got a majority, such a coalition will forever be but speculation. With the vanquishing of the "vieux partis" and the socialist CCF, the sky's the limit as to what the charismatic and ideologically driven Caouette will do next. With Centennial celebrations planned for July, Canada has decided that it wants a new and radical path for the nation's second century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Australia

ast_txtev1 = Australian Labor Prime Minister Kim Beazley has resigned after a pork-barreling scandal claimed several high-profile members of the Federal Cabinet. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were funneled into marginal seats in a plot to steer the results in Labor's favor. Beazley was not implicated, but cited his failure to "turn the searchlight of absolute honesty" onto his party as the reason for his resignation. Dr. Herbert V. Evatt, a leading member of the ALP's Left faction, has been chosen as the party's interim leader, making him the current Prime Minister of Australia. The erratic former High Court judge will preside over the Government until its parliamentary caucus convenes to elect the man who will carry it to the upcoming snap election. However, Labor's poor performance in nationwide opinion polls and Evatt's declining health have stirred rumors of a leadership challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev2 = Once considered a black sheep, even amongst his own party, it appears that the winds of Fortune have changed decisively in Paul Hasluck's favour. A proponent of Old Tory-style Paternalism, the fact that he is in the Liberal Party at all may strike as contradictory. With the Liberal Party being comprised of devotees of the creed to devolve Canberra's outreach and place more emphasis on the individual and states, Hasluck's victory doesn't simply signal a change for the country, but a change at the very foundation of Australian politics. With this electoral upset, Australia has chosen firmly to look into their past to solve the problems of their present. In his victory speech, Hasluck referenced the 'lack of unity' within society, pledging to 'mend the divide' and to 'fix society' once and for all. Moreover, Hasluck promised that "every citizen will feel naturally obliged to lend each other aid". Whether Hasluck can push his bold vision through Parliament - with rumblings of dissent in his own party - is another issue entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev3 = It appears that there is a new wind blowing through Australia. But not quite as new as one would think. The Australian Labor Party have triumphed once more at the polls despite their scandal two months prior, and insider party scheming and politicking has led to an old guard candidate on the "Right" Wing of the ALP. Arthur Calwell has claimed victory in the recent snap election in Australia. While the powers of the world eye up Calwell's still unclear intentions abroad, that stands in sharp contrast to his policies at home. Arguing for nothing less than full liberties to the Labor Unions that make up the vast industries of Oceania and the unflinching preservation of a White Australia, Calwell will use everything in his arsenal - including his characteristically silver tongue - to move the members of Parliament into voting for his measures. Yes, there is a new wind blowing through Australia, and that wind calls for the downtrodden and dispossessed in society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev4 = In a sea of elderly geriatrics and 'Alter Kämpfers' within politics, it seems that the voters of Australia have decided their pick shall be someone much more fresh-faced in the hot seat of the Premiership. John Gorton, a member of the Liberal Party, has taken the decisive lead he needs to become the next Prime Minister of Australia. A relative newcomer to the political scene, his ideology is like few others in the nation. Combining a policy of social progress and rights for the individual with his fervent support for the nation's economy to become more self-reliant and promotion of Australian businesses, the news must have been bad news for the economic masterminds in the United States seeking to deepen ties with the nation. However if this has been a minor bump for the OFN, it has been a catastrophe for Tokyo. Gorton has pledged his unwavering support against the Empire of Japan, with tensions between the two devolving almost immediately. But only time will tell what Gorton has planned for the Land Down Under.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev5 = As one of the few remaining OFN-aligned nations in Japan's Mare Nostrum in the Pacific, both Tokyo and Washington have watched the elections with an impassioned interest. In these turbulent times, the voters of Australia have emphasised the need for dependability and trust in their Premier. It is then little surprise that Clyde Cameron has seized the lead and triumphed in the elections. An infamous pragmatist within the Labor Party, Cameron has managed to use his allies within the grinding gears of the Party Machine to become the ALP's choice for the ballot. While he has triumphed within, the road to keep Adelaide Avenue was always going to be one fraught with dangers and potholes. While his opponents may spin the re-election of a party that was embroiled in a scandal a few months ago - as a negative, Cameron's use of rhetoric and capitalisation of the uncertainty of the so-called 'Cold War' has erupted in a surge of votes in his favour. Now with a finely attuned Parliamentarian in power, many wonder what's next for the continent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev6 = In an unexpected upset, controversial former Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's Country-Liberal Coalition has narrowly triumphed in what has proven to be one of the most polarizing federal elections in Australian history. Known for his brash demeanor and suppression of protests and strikes, Bjelke-Petersen's detractors have labeled him a populist and political rule breaker, labels he's seemingly embraced. Campaigning on a highly publicised platform of anti-socialism and conservatism, observers have commented that much of Joh's support came as a backlash to the perceived alienation caused by previous governments. Already the new Prime Minister has become embroiled in controversy as he jubilantly announced that the 'communist plotters' of the Labor Party wouldn't be returning to the Prime Ministership 'any time soon'. Some Australians fear Joh may be here to stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ast_txtev7 = Australian Prime Minister Joh Bjelke-Petersen has done the unthinkable. Live on national television, the PM took out a copy of the Australian Constitution and tore it apart with a pair of scissors, shortly before announcing that his government would no longer be bound by it. Condemning the Constitution as "another tool of the elites", he proclaimed that a new era of 'proper governance' had begun in Australia. An especially egregious act even in Joh's own history of media manipulation and rampant cronyism, observers note that a tipping point has been reached in an administration that has up to now seen multiple escalating controversies. In light of this truly historic moment, riots have broken out in every single major city across the continent, with an unprecedented joint statement from both the Labor and Liberal Party accusing Bjelke-Petersen of 'totalitarianism reminiscent of Adolf Hitler'. As police squads scour the country for unruly protesters and any of those that stand in Joh's way, a dawn is rising over Australia. Even if it threatens to scorch all in its way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

chl_txtev1 = The cascading effect of Alessandri's folly continues, as Hugo Zepeda Barrios is inaugurated as President of Chile. A compromise candidate from the Liberal Party after the failed Agrarian Reform, Zepeda was reluctantly backed by both centrist and right-wing parties in order to prevent a victory from Allende and the FRAP. Rarely does a figure like Zepeda step into the seat of president. President of the Senate and of the Liberal Party, Zepeda has shown little interest in the executive branch until last year. Uninterested in sweeping reforms, Zepeda has committed to using international trade and federalism to solve the nation's woes, maintaining that personal liberties must be protected - at any cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev2 = It seems compassion has come to the Andes, as Eduardo Frei Montalva is inaugurated to the Chilean Presidency. Leader of the progressive faction of the Conservatives and vocal supporter of Christian democracy, Frei easily defeated the opposing leftist FRAP after uniting the right and center on a unified ticket. Frei's plans may not align with the leftists, but he is still very much a reformer. His detailed outlines call for changes to every sector of government, from a reinvigorated agrarian reform to a massive expansion to social services, all in hopes of uplifting the lives of Chile's poor. Whether Frei can get his reforms through congress, a new day is dawning above Santiago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev3 = The remnants of the Alessandri administration remain in Santiago today, as Julio Philippi Izquierdo is inaugurated President of Chile. An independent supported by the FDC and much of the center, Philippi ran a campaign that united the right and center in the face of a unified leftist offensive from the FRAP. An independent minister dedicated to his various positions, Philippi became well known during the Alessandri administration, where his intense dedication to his various ministries gave him national attention. Philippi has promised to continue the push against partisan struggles, promising an apolitical, technocratic touch as he begins his slate of policies - most importantly, land reform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev4 = Just two years ago, the idea that Salvador Allende Gossens would be president would be unthinkable. Yet after failed negotiations by the right, Allende has managed to push past his contenders - and past the hands of Congress - to become the first democratically-elected marxist in history. Coming to power in a storm of violence and dysfunction, dark clouds swirl around the just-inagurated president. While Allende has begun to outline his "Chilean Path to Socialism", promising to liberate the nation from "capitalism, foreign exploitation, and bourgeois democracy", the opposition has already begun organizing against him and his supporters. It seems Allende's path to socialism may be rockier than he expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev5 = Cheers through Santiago today as Jorge Prat Echaurren is inaugurated President of Chile. Backed by conservatives, independents, and even some leftists. Prat's unified right-wing ticket has propelled himself to the highest seat in Chile. A champion of women's suffrage and a vocal opponent of the FDC, Prat has always been an unusual conservative. Already he has laid out a slate of reforms for Chile, from land reform to Latin American integration, all tinged with his corporatist ideals. Most importantly, he has committed himself to preventing the overreach of Congress with severe regulations over their authority. Whatever he does next, it is clear that Chile is due to change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev6 = Latin America has been sent reeling in the aftermath of today's news as Chilean President Jorge Prat has declared the immediate dissolution of Congress, including a total ban on political parties. This news has followed on the heels of an incredibly polarized impeachment process against Prat, which led to near-anarchic conditions in the "spine of South America". Already, tanks and infantrymen swarm the capital - Santiago - declaring martial law across the entire country. Those members of Congress that haven't been arrested, have either fled across the border or have disappeared entirely - and some have even been found dead. While Prat has denounced these murders, and his involvement, it appears that the President now has total control over the country. With his chief supporters - including Colonel Roberto Viaux - Prat seems destined to mould the fluid fate of Chile, in his iron clasp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev7 = Pictures of tanks rolling in the streets of Santiago have come out of Chile as news of a military coup lead by one Colonel Roberto Viaux have been confirmed. Troops loyal to Viaux surrounded the Presidential and Congressional buildings and forced the Chilean government to hand over power to him. Viaux's coup comes following sociopolitical breakdown in Chile and his rise to stardom after allegations of governmental mistreatment of military personnel. Viaux has cited Chile's instability and internal turmoil as justification for the deposition of the President, dissolution of Congress and the establishment of a "Revolutionary Junta" consisting of both civilian and military figures, which promises radical change to Chile. While further developments have been scarce, many are left to wonder if this shall bring back order to the Southern Cone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
chl_txtev8 = It appears that democracy in Chile has narrowly avoided a premature death today as news reports have come of a failed coup attempt by factions in the military. Colonel Roberto Viaux surrounded the Presidential Palace, in the early, frosty hours of the morning and called for the resignation of the Chilean President and Congress. While it appears that the military was to initiate a bombardment of the Palace, loyal members of the Chilean military have risen up and organised a counter-coup of sorts. Eventually, after threats of a civil war drew worryingly near, the coup members surrendered. Now, Colonel Viaux lies imprisoned and awaits trial. Whatever the case, it appears that the Chilean government has proven their capability, and have utilised it well, as a slim chance to return stability to the shaken nation appears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Mexico

mex_txtev1 = After yet another landslide election, Raúl Salinas Lozano of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional has been elected president of the United Mexican States. A rare free trade advocate within his party, the country's secretary of industry and commerce is decried both by opposition and fellow PRI for 'betraying the revolution in practice'. His victory comes as an unsettling shock to local businesses enjoying protectionist policies - but also as a welcome surprise to enterprises from Japan. As congratulations are exchanged across the Pacific, Mexico seems ready to enter the world with an eye towards the horizon's Rising Sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
mex_txtev2 = The outcome of the 1964 Mexican presidential election has unsurprisingly resulted in a victory for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, who have dominated national politics for decades. Far more surprising, however, was the new president-elect. Presently governor of Tabasco, Carlos A. Madrazo will be the first man in decades to have held the presidency prior to any cabinet appointment. A firebrand of the PRI's left wing and a staunch economic protectionist, Madrazo promises to protect the ideals of the Mexican Revolution from corruption, greed and foreign imperialism. As the Mexican economy has in recent years been a fierce battlefield between American and Japanese concerns, however, it remains to be seen if Madrazo can accomplish his grand vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
mex_txtev3 = Following another landslide election, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional has been elected president of the United Mexican States. The secretary of the interior is infamous for his callous, heavy-handed treatment of anti-government protests during the Mateos administration, leaving dissidents within the country fearful for their already dangerous future. Regardless, the United States has extended its congratulations to Mexico for "electing a leader who can guide the country through these times of tumult". It seems Mexico is poised to enter the world stage once more - and this time, under the Americans' guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Sweden

swe_txtev1 = Sweden finds itself in a state of shock today as the social democratic Prime Minister Tage Erlander was assassinated shortly after midnight in Stockholm by unknown assailants. Speaking to the press, the National Police Commissioner Carl Persson stated that they currently have no definitive suspects in their search. The loss of the nation's postwar leader comes as the turmoil in Germany and Ostland has thrown Sweden's economy into disarray, worsening an already dire situation. Taking over from Erlander is the nation's Foreign Minister, Torsten Nilsson. He urged his countrymen towards calm and unity in this unprecedented time of crisis. Swedish elections are scheduled to go ahead as planned despite the tragic loss of Erlander. A state funeral will be attended by the leaders of the nation's major parties, all vowing not to let politics overshadow the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
swe_txtev2 = Sweden's incumbent SAP has won the nation's elections, securing another term for the party and maintaining their three-decade grip on power. In a time of crisis, Sweden has chosen to entrust the party with governing experience. Calling for unity, Nilsson pledged that the visions of Hansson and Erlander would not die with them and that he would work tirelessly to save the nation's economy and restore a sense of normality to its people. The SAP's stunning victory was widely expected thanks to the party's track record and an outpouring of support following the murder of Erlander.
With their popular mandate confirmed for another four years, it would seem like business as usual is the order of the day. This will certainly be pleasant news to Germania as Sweden, despite its official status as a neutral state, is seen as the Pakt's northern bulwark and one of the Reich's most reliable trade partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
swe_txtev3 = After three decades of social democratic rule, Sweden finds itself with a new party in power as the liberal coalition led by Bertil Ohlin won the people's faith to guide the nation out of the crisis caused by the turmoil in Germany. The FP's proclamation of a new course, however, is going to be one of a very lagom nature. An internationally noted economist, Ohlin ran on a platform calling for a soft landing from the years of SAP rule and a détente with the OFN nations following decades of frosty post-war relations.
While domestically significant, FP winning is seen as a minor upset at best that most analysts predict will do little to change international affairs as Stockholm is likely to retain a close partner of Germany even if there is a thaw between Sweden and America. So far, both Germania and Washington have been cautiously optimistic over the new management in Stockholm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
swe_txtev4 = The Swedish elections have ended in an unexpected upset as the conservative HP soared to power. Seen as the junior partner in the rightist coalition, the energetic Jarl Hjalmarson managed to captivate the electorate and earn the trust to guide the nation out of its current crisis. Signalling a sharp turn from the previous administration, the new government has promised sweeping Laissez-Faire reforms and reviving ties with America following decades of frosty relations. Analysts have been caught off-guard by this result although some speculate that this could be the beginning of a diplomatic re-alignment for the Scandinavian nation, albeit with slowly paced steps.
Unsurprisingly, the cautious optimism in Washington is unlikely to be mirrored in Germania. While Sweden is guaranteed to remain close to the Pakt for now, its long-term status inside Germania's sphere casts itself into doubt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
swe_txtev5 = The Swedish elections have concluded in a stunning upset that has caught almost everyone off-guard as Nils Flyg's red-brown SSSP alliance beat all odds to claim victory with a rallying call for radical change in a time of boiling dissatisfaction with the establishment. In a short speech, the ageing politician said that Sweden had now taken the first step of its nationalist revolution, one that would let them achieve socialism without foreign submission.
This turn of events has stunned analysts but all agree that the election is yet more bad news for Germany, considering many of its elements cut from the same cloth that Germany purged in the infamous Night of the Long Knives.
While no one knows for sure, the ramshackle alliance of nationalistic socialists,
German-aligned ex-Communists and agrarian National Socialists will likely lead to uncertainty, gridlock and a turn towards autarky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Philippines

phi_txtev1 = After years of seeming inactivity, an alliance between the Philippines' two largest rebel groups has commenced its largest attack against the Second Philippine Republic to date. Border towns are engulfed by gunfire and artillery shells as the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive shatters the conflict's long stalemate. Caught largely by surprise, the Philippine Constabulary and Japanese 14th Army have been forced to conduct fighting retreats, and in some cases were routed off the battlefield completely. Questions abound now that the conflict nears the Pearl of the Orient with every inch gained or ceded. Will the so-called "Puppet Republic" survive its ordeal? Will it fall? Who will fell it: the socialists to the north, or the old Commonwealth's remnants to the south? How will the Sun and Eagle respond? Time will tell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
spr_txtev1 = A bastard son proves his worth as a man in a baptism of fire. It is a tale as old as time, and now the Second Philippine Republic, once regarded as false pretenders kept alive by the almighty yen, adds another entry to the hallowed catalogue. Once close to national extinction, the men of Manila had held until the dreaded insurgents wore themselves out, after which commenced a brutal counteroffensive all the way to their strongholds. Celebrations dragged on for days and nights after President Jose Yulo announced the surrender of the last major rebel holdout in Mindanao Island. The worst, it seems for many, is over. Although the pains of reconstruction await, the Filipino people can now face them with their heads held high no matter what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
spr_txtev2 = The Philippines' new president Claro Mayo Recto has been sworn in, capping off weeks of instability across the island nation that included the assassination of his predecessor, José Yulo. The poet and nationalist firebrand who previously served as president of the 1934 Constitutional Convention took his oath in a traditional ceremony at Rizal Park, the historic park by Manila Bay. His inauguration comes after a violent struggle for influence between Japan and the United States. Known as the "Balintawak Blitz," the conflict saw the defeat of both communist insurgents and Commonwealth government remnants. In his inaugural speech, Recto vowed to abandon compromise and to protect his home country against the influence of colonialism. It remains unclear how far Recto is willing to go for his vision of Filipino freedom and prosperity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
spr_txtev3 = If the College of Cardinals in Rome shouts "Habemus Papam!" after voting a new pope, then so too did the National Assembly shout their own chant - "Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!" - after announcing the inauguration of Quintin Paredes to a restive crowd outside Malacañan Palace. Soft-spoken and erudite, the former Minister of Public Works and Communications has vowed to continue both his predecessor's reforms and building consensus within the KALIBAPI. His appointment comes as a relief for those who resent Malacañan's historically despotic streak. On the other hand, his opponents decry his recalcitrance on pursuing Tagalogisasyon, punishing traitors, and in general committing fully to Jose Laurel's vision. Will Paredes' laws triumph over a nation of strongmen? As goes the old proverb: many hope, but few believe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
spr_txtev4 = Sergio Osmeña Jr. has been sworn as President of the Second Philippine Republic early today in an elaborate ceremony at Malacañan, the Spanish colonial-era presidential palace by Manila's Pasig River. Darkhorse among the late President Yulo's heirs-apparent, the Cebuano businessman was accompanied by his fellow magnates and the Assemblymen he had courted to ensure his ascent. Osmeña's inauguration marks the formal end of a violent struggle for influence between Japan and the United States. The "Balintawak Blitz," as it is called, saw both communist insurgents and Commonwealth Army remnants defeated by government forces - a tragedy, said their new commander-in-chief, he enjoins Filipinos on all sides to forgive. Observers note that Osmeña conciliatory speech obscured a conspicuous absence of Laurelist sentiment, suggesting his reformist agenda may be more expansive than previously thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
frp_txtev1 = Shocking news has arrived from the heart of the Orient's Pearl as reports of casualties from the city flood in day by day from what is now dubbed the "Manila Incident." The unraveling of an unknown series of events has caused the capital city of the victorious Second Philippine Republic to fall into disarray, with rioters seen wreaking havoc in the streets. Some speculate that this was caused by a botched reconstruction campaign to rebuild the country in the aftermath of the JALO, but no one knows for sure. With Manila in anarchy, 14th Army General Masazumi Inada disbanded the National Assembly shortly after its members relocated to the northern city of Baguio. He has since invoked his powers to preside over an interim military government until Manila is pacified. News organizations are finding it difficult to attain more details on the unfolding situation, as the city is deemed to be too dangerous to venture into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
frp_txtev2 = The Japanese have returned to the Philippines. Following the success of the "Balintawak Blitz" in removing the Japanese puppet regime, it seems that Tokyo is willing to spill further blood to maintain its hold on the Orient's Pearl. Early this morning, advance groups belonging to Shinobu Takayama's 14th Army came ashore in the Ilocos region of Luzon island. With the element of surprise, the Japanese forces were able to quickly capture the cities of San Fernando and Dagupan. While the attack was able to take the Filipino defenders by surprise, it was known to be only a matter of time until Japan came calling once more. Having already broken free from the Rising Sun, the Filipinos are likely to offer a stiff and protracted defence. Whatever the outcome will be, the island is once again bathed in fire and blood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

afr_txtev1 = It has been over three hundred years since the first Filipino was made a slave for a Spaniard's plantations. His overlords may have changed many times since, but not his plight. His land's material condition, thus it is said, is ground as fertile for revolution as it is for rice, blossoming a torrent which courses unrelentingly through its mountains and valleys. Manila has now witnessed the red tide firsthand as jubilant workers and peasants hoist their red flag all over the newly-taken city. Meanwhile, Supremo Luis Taruc declared triumphantly that the "fascist and imperialist spectre" that had haunted the country for over four hundred years is nearly vanquished. All that is left, he continues, is to prepare for a protracted struggle against Japan's inevitable return. Where the Americans and their southern lackeys factor into it remains unaddressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

The UFF, an alliance between the Communists and USFIP has emerged victorious, having defeated the Japanese twice in recent memory. Over a radio broadcast, the UFF leaders Luis Taruc and Wendell Fertig expressed hope that the secured peace will allow for a peaceful unification of the islands. Washington has already pledged to aid the future unified government, seeking to establish a strong foothold in the Japanese dominated Pacific. Tokyo meanwhile has stayed completely silent on the matter, although it is speculated that the failure of the 14th Army to regain control has given the government severe concerns about its own military capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

The decades-long conflict within the region has been put to an end after the official unification of the isles has been announced on Manila by Wendell Fertig of the USFIP and Luis Taruc of the AFRSR. With this announcement, the whole of the Philippine Islands is now under the rule of a unified coalition government of democratic sympathizers and socialists, under the official name of the Coalition Government of the Republic of the Philippines. The acting president, Lorenzo Tañada, promises to do away with the failures of the old, and forge a path of democracy for the Philippines, though the world doubts the stability of this new government, it is certainly a path to a brighter future for the Philippines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
cgp_txtev3 = It seems the status quo that now-former President Tañada established in the Philippines has been torn apart by his own Coalition, as Luis Taruc and his revolutionaries assumed a majority within the country's sole legal party. Tañada's resignation culminates a fraught, months-long reconstruction program marred by mismanagement and delays. Taruc was quick to exploit the president's setbacks, tarring him as an incompetent before the Assembly while stoking dissent within a slowly disillusioned populace. This set the stage for mass defections to the Coalition's left wing - and with demobilization underway, the Philippine Army could only give its begrudging consent to Taruc's "bloodless revolution". Now secure, the self-styled General Secretary has promised a utopia of, by, and for the workers and peasants. Whether or not he'll fulfill it remains to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
cgp_txtev4 = Hours after bystanders spotted army trucks surreptitiously leaving Malacañan, President Tañada announced his resignation over national radio. Effective 12 midnight, the office was to be assumed by former Maj. Gen. Ramon F. Magsaysay. Tañada's resignation culminates a fraught, months-long reconstruction program marred, according to the war hero, by "political gridlock and Red sabotage." His denouncements proved decisive among the Coalition's alienated Assemblymen, who subsequently abandoned Tañada's vacillations for the decisive action Magsaysay espoused. Paired with the Army's unconditional support of its own, and perhaps today's events were obvious in hindsight. Although the new Soldier-President promised more democratic rule once "the situation has defused", many an op-ed wondered when such a moment will arrive - or if it will ever arrive at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
prp_txtev1 = Surprising news has arrived from the Philippines, as it seems that Filipino communists have defeated both the Japanese 14th Army and American-backed guerilla force. As cooperation between the two guerilla forces have ended in disaster, the initially small resistance in Northern Luzon fought off the Americans as well as the Japanese, and now, the People's Republic has become the sole undisputed ruler of the Philippine isles. Formerly known as the All-Filipino Revolutionary Socialist Republic, Supremo Luis Taruc declared his intention of forming a united Filipino government under socialist rule with the formation of the People's Republic of the Philippines after negotiations broke down between them and the USFIP. With only sporadic fighting in the countryside remaining, and any form of significant organized resistance gone, the triumphant Taruc has finally realized his dream of a free Philippines under socialist rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
prp_txtev2 = With the victory of Luis Taruc and the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas in the Philippine islands, it seemed that continued socialist rule over the islands was cemented for the foreseeable future, until recently. Ferdinand Marcos of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, "The New Society Movement" has launched a coup d'état against the Supremo of the People's Republic of the Philippines established only a few months prior. Seeing that it was necessary to secure his position, Luis Taruc had ordered a "liquidation" of subversive non-communist elements within the nation after the war. Ferdinand Marcos, backed by the remaining center and right-wing movements within the country, staged a coup to oust Taruc out of power in response to this purge. As the chaos settled down, a new page has been turned in the book of the Philippines, under the guidance of Ferdinand Edralin Marcos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
usp_txtev1 = General Wendell Fertig of the USFIP has issued a cessation of hostilities in Manila today after weeks of heavy fighting, declaring the city liberated "from the forces of Japan and the illegitimate Yulo regime". His "guerrilla army" has defied expectations by ousting the SPR from their national capital in a successful, if protracted and bloody, campaign. Although no less damaged than large swaths of Luzon's largest city, Malacañan Palace now flies Old Glory and the old Commonwealth banner side to side - a first in over twenty years. Interim President Yulo and his Cabinet had evacuated to Tokyo prior to the siege; no formal surrender seems forthcoming despite their setback. Across the Pacific, Americans and Filipino expatriates alike rejoice at the long occupation's surprising end. Nevertheless, homecoming celebrations are tempered by the likelihood of a reprisal invasion not unlike that which had toppled the Philippines' last civilian government in 1942.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
usp_txtev2 = The quagmire in the Philippines seems to have finally ended, as the Islands return once more under American rule. The OFN Mandate of the Philippines, led by American General Dwight Edward Beach, has defeated both the communists and Japan's 14th army and now stands tall as the new leaders of the Philippines. While guerilla fighting is still heavy from the communists now fighting against the Americans in the northern section of Luzon, Beach's victory appears to be cemented nonetheless, as America has already sent its congratulations to the victorious general. Although the government have said that transition to a home-rule government in the isles are to be done as soon as possible, no signs of any military withdrawal from the islands by the United States can be seen. Perhaps, the Philippines have yet to gain their independence after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
usp_txtev3 = The seemingly unending decades-long conflict within the Philippines have come to an end, as Wendell Fertig of the United States Forces in the Philippines have emerged triumphant from the fog of war. With relations breaking down between the communist forces of the AFRSR, the islands were forced into another three-way conflict, resulting in untold chaos and devastation within the islands, and now the USFIP stands tall as the victor of the war, eliminating the Japanese and the communist rebels. General Wendell Fertig has announced to the world that he will begin reconstruction of the battered island chains, and for the return of a civilian government to the isles once the reconstruction process has finished. Aside from the disgruntled politicians in Tokyo, the world breathes a sigh of relief as another nation bears the torch of freedom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

par_txtev1 = The collapse of the German hegemony due to the Civil War has shaken the New Order in Europe beyond recognition and cut off their various foreign clients from their lifeline. Nowhere is a clearer case of the latter found than in Paraguay, which has been put on the ropes as a result. Rumours indicate that as German support receded, the Mburuvicha - Leader - of Paraguay, Higinio Morínigo, found himself a less and less attractive option as leader to the members of his allied Colorado faction, the Guión Rojo. The result was, of course, a coup by members of the Guión Rojo, who have unceremoniously forced him out. As the new government is primarily composed of members of the old government, not very much is likely to change in Paraguay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Nowhere is a clearer case of the latter found than in Paraguay, where rumours indicate that the stability of the regime shattered and caused various former supporters to break off from it. Having failed to wrestle control over the security forces, the dictator Higinio Morínigo has swiftly been deposed by a coup. The new government is made up of the remnants of the pre-dictatorship Colorado Party, who advocate for moderate conservatism along corporatist lines. However, the situation in Paraguay is still tense; further changes in the landscape cannot yet be ruled out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

The government has been unceremoniously forced out and replaced by the Guión Rojo. As the new government is primarily composed of members of the old, pre-coup government, a return to the prior governance style of Higinio Morínigo may be expected, though the former dictator himself has not been allowed to return from exile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

The deeply militarist, pro-German and xenophobic Frente de Guerra led by Mutsuhito Villasboa has seized the government.

A shutdown of exports has frozen its economy and generated a wave of popular anger, as welfare runs dry and rationing brings ordinary life to a halt. Seizing their chance, a coalition of exiled rebels has returned home and launched an all-out attack on the regime, plunging the countryside into a brutal guerrilla war. The rebels, known as the United Front for National Liberation, or FULNA, are a diverse group of Liberals, Communists, social democrats, and discontented soldiers, all united under the command of the charismatic and mysterious "Señor Paraguay". They are highly motivated and well-led, but whether they can triumph over the heavily armed Paraguayan military remains to be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Citing the hopeless military situation and "the government's assault on national dignity", Field Marshal Estigarribia has declared his allegiance to the Liberal Party and ended the Paraguayan Bush War with a swift military coup. Tired of defending the thuggish regime, and grateful to avoid their otherwise certain deaths, few of his soldiers objected when Estigarribia agreed to join the FULNA Provisional Junta. Although certain regime hardliners have vowed to fight on, Ernesto Guevara shaking hands with Estigarribia on the steps of the Palacio de López marks the end of large-scale hostilities in the country. Whatever the future holds for Paraguay, it seems the Decades of Infamy have finally come to an end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Chávez' triumphant government is made up of the consolidated remnants of the pre-Morínigo Colorado Party, who advocate for moderate conservatism along corporatist lines. With their rule solidified and order seemingly returning, the regime now aims its sights towards restoring political stability and is implementing a program of reform "to guide Paraguay into the future."

par_txtev7 = News coming out of the Paraguayan capital of Asunción indicates that the reformist regime led by Federico Chávez has been toppled by General Alfredo Stroessner. The coup seems to have taken place due to the backfire of a recent crackdown on opponents by the reformist Paraguayan regime combined with a widespread established fear of further German influence re-entering the country. This resulted in the creation of enough momentum for the opposition to organize and strike under the leadership of the now-President Stroessner. The new regime has already become well-known for its ruthless and brutal dismantling of the fascist regime's legacy, but just as much for its tendency to brutally crack down on anything it considers subversive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Now, the elderly Estigarribia promises Paraguay a future of liberalization, economic development, modernization, and normalization of international ties.

Just how few expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .\n

#Peru

pru_txtev1 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a surprising victor rises from the muck of fraud allegations by all parties- Manuel Seoane, of the APN. Seoane, himself a former member of the APRA, headed the leftist APN into their first election. Widely expected to place third or fourth, his victory has sent shockwaves through Peruvian politics- never has Peru had a politician like Seoane in her highest office. Though he promises sweeping reform to improve the lives of all Peruvians, it will be difficult for the APN to pass their agenda, as they face hostility from all other parties. Perhaps most worrisome is the eerie silence of the military- yet, it's a good sign that they've even let Seoane in office at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev2 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a widely accepted winner emerges from the swamp of fraud allegations from all parties- Moreyra Paz Soldán, Prado's chosen successor. Though many were skeptical of Paz, it seems that his campaign promise to continue the order that Prado created has been enough to push him to the top. However, with a new Congress and new crises both within and without the nation, questions still swirl over whether Paz has the drive to deal with the many problems that plague the nation. After all, if Prado wasn't able to, why would his successor be any different?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev3 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a surprising victor rises from the muck of fraud allegations by all parties- Pedro Beltrán, head editor of La Prensa and ex-economic minister. Beltrán's victory comes as a surprise to many, namely due to his unpopular welfare cuts during his time as economic minister under Prado. However, with the Peruvian economy still sluggish, it seems that the people have had a change of heart on his ideas. However, Beltrán will not go unchallenged- the left has rushed to declare opposition, and internal conflict within Peru only seems to be on the upswing. With the UNO behind him, Peru watches as Beltrán readies his policies- for they can only hope that he is the answer that has long eluded them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev4 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a widely accepted winner emerges from the swamp of fraud allegations from all parties- Manuel Odría, former President and general, returned to serve his second term. Manuel Odría's first term was dominated by the shadow of the National Security Act, which would lead to the Iquitos Massacre that spelled the ignominious end of his first spin in office. Once again campaigning on the promise of order, stability, and progress, Odría has proven his Japanocentric, anti-APRA brand of right-wing populism still holds sway within Peru. However, with other major parties being noncommittal at best to Odría's government, the seasoned veteran will need to bring all he has if he wishes for more success in his second term than in his first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev5 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a widely accepted winner emerges from the swamp of fraud allegations from all parties- Fernando Belaúnde Terry, leader of the AP. First rising to prominence in 1957, Belaúnde was beaten out by Prado. This time around, his promises of liberal change and restored stability to the troubled nation seem to have borne fruit. Belaúnde will not govern unimpeded, however- his coalition holds only a plurality in government, and Odría's UNO has already declared themselves as opposition. Though Belaúnde has offered to work with any party who is willing, the other parties, if united against him, would be able to strangle his dreams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev6 = Peru has always been one for chaotic election seasons, and 1963 has proven no exception. As the sun sets on Election Day, a surprising victor rises from the muck of fraud allegations by all parties- Héctor Cornejo Chávez, leader of the Partido Demócrata Cristiano. An obscure figure, Cornejo was expected to come far behind the others. Instead, he and his supporters have found themselves on top. However, Cornejo's vision of a restored, religious Peru faces problems out the gate- conflicts within and without his own party threaten to end his presidency before it even gets going. Some even say that Cornejo is nothing more than a puppet of the ACDN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev7 = Though Manuel Prado Ugarteche's term was sure to end in 1963, none predicted it to end as it has today. The two-time President of Peru was shot while he visited Northern Peru. Though the assassin has not been apprehended, taking into account Northern Peru's history of socialist resistance, many suspect the culprit may be involved with remnants of the long-dismantled APRA. Vice President Gallo Porras has been sworn in to replace his predecessor, promising to continue Prado's policies of moderate conservatism. Unfortunately for Gallo and Peru, Prado's death comes mere months before an election that already promised to be chaotic- and with the military mobilized and alert for further threats, the chances of a peaceful transition of power may have gone up in smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
pru_txtev8 = When Gallo Porras took office mere months ago, few had high hopes for him. After all, few, if any, Peruvian Presidents had ever ascended to the role in such disastrous circumstances. With the continued instability only exacerbated by a chaotic election marred with allegations of widespread voter fraud, it came as no surprise to the people of Lima as they woke up to the sound of tank treads rolling through the city. Led by General Ricardo Pérez Godoy, the new junta is expected to temporarily restrict civil liberties until order is restored- though how temporary those restrictions are, and what the junta's definition of order is, remains to be seen. As citizens spill into the streets to protest, and whispers spread of the APRA being more existent than previously thought, one thing remains certain- the nation's chaos is not yet over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Brazil

bra_txtev1 = A concerning development comes out of Brazil today, where President Henrique Teixeira Lott has announced his resignation from office. With a major corruption scandal regarding the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway breaking out after a public denunciation by Vice-President Jânio Quadros, public opinion rapidly turned against President Lott, who now found himself in danger of a potentially successful impeachment process. Rather than allow the crisis to escalate, Lott stepped down.Jânio Quadros has now taken over as President after defeating a short-lived plot in Congress that sought to depose him, leaving the immediate fate of Brazil in his hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev1_1 = As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Jânio Quadros enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. The vice-president in the previous government of President Henrique Lott, he won election as a prominent leader of the conservative UDN. Quadros, known for his flamboyant and erratic behavior, is a staunch conservative who plans to promote his concept of "traditionalism" in Brazil. He is also a fanatical opponent of corruption and talks frequently of sweeping Brazil clean of corruption, to the point of being popularly known as the "Broom". Even more important to him than either of these, however, is his plan to establish an independent Brazilian foreign policy, which international observers believe may complicate the Brazilian-American relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev2 = An unexpected development in Brazil's current constitutional crisis has occurred today. Army commanders led by General Silvio Frota have issued an ultimatum to the legislature to end the current anarchy 'within the next hundred days'. Implicit in the army's command is the threat of a military intervention, were the civilian leaders to fail in solving the crisis. The republic left headless after the resignations of President Lott following a corruption scandal over the Trans-Amazonian Highway, and the following resignation of Vice President Quadros. What began as an attempt by Vice-President Quadros to seize power has turned into the gravest constitutional crisis since the end of Vargas' dictatorship. Brazilians of all political stripes have called for their leaders to end their clash before the generals run out of patience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev3 = Shocking news has come from Brazil where the military has dissolved the legislature and appointed one of their own as President of Brazil. Stating the recent chaotic events that have taken place in Brazil, the military has used this as a pretext to conduct the military coup. Protests that arose after the coup d'état have been quickly suppressed and beaten back, while prominent opposition leaders have either been arrested or have fled the country. Ex-President Henrique Lott has also been arrested and detained for attempting to rally officers within the military to enact a counter-coup and restore the legislature. While the Military has stated that they will only be in charge of an emergency government, and will restore democracy as soon as it is feasibly possible. However many wonder whether this is simply just a lie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev4 = Despite the combined political opposition of Brazil's military establishment and Carlos Lacerda's União Democrática Nacional, former President Juscelino Kubitschek has returned to the halls of Brasília in a major upset victory. Kubitschek's unexpected triumph arrived in the Latin American nation's first lot of elections after its most recent military coup. Across Brazil, the newly announced President-elect's supporters have flooded the streets in celebration, with protestors appearing in near equal numbers. The ensuing clashes, in some cases, led to brutal street-fighting, but the popular mood is suffused in Kubitschek's optimism, with many proclaiming the triumph of Brazilian democracy over military influence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev4_1 = As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Juscelino Kubitschek enters Brasília's Palácio do Planalto - whose construction he oversaw - as the President of Brazil for the second time in a decade. As with the last time around, he ran as the candidate of the centre-left PSD-PTB coalition. Compared to his previous accession in 1955, when he had to rely on the support of the military to drive back a coup attempt, there has been a lack of chaos. Observers consider this a indicator of relative stability, unusual given the tumult that surrounds the Brazilian democratic process. Kubitschek, not one to rest on his laurels, is already getting to work. Rumour has it that he will be instituting more of the massive infrastructure and construction programs that were his trademark during the first Kubitschek presidency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

bra_txtev5_1 = As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, João Goulart enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. A grandee of the PTB - a Varguist party - he is an enthusiastic follower of the methods of the influential Getúlio Vargas, and a collaborator of the former president Henrique Teixeira Lott. Formerly vice-president under the government of Juscelino Kubitschek, he has played an integral role on the PTB's coalition with the centre-left PSD. Having now assumed office, Goulart prepares to implement significant reforms in order to build what he believes will be a better, more just society. But rumbles of discontent among conservative and military circles in Brazil mean that he may face far more difficulty in doing this than he and the PTB hoped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
bra_txtev6 = Carlos Lacerda, presidential candidate for Brazil's União Democrática Nacional, has won his bid for the Latin American nation's Presidency, overcoming former President Juscelino Kubitschek in a widely anticipated election result. Amid small-scale protests and politically charged street brawls, the former Governor of Guanabara was declared, as the victor of the nation's post-coup elections, President-elect of Brazil. Lacerda's victory comes in the wake of allegations of military favoritism and pro-UDN election meddling. However, these claims have detracted little from the prevailing perception that, with Lacerda in power, Brazilian democracy shall enjoy a new, resurgent age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

A strong-willed conservative grandee of the right-wing UDN, he is a fanatical opponent of the ideology and methods of Getúlio Vargas, which he and his cadres pejoratively call "Getulism". A journalist by trade, he rose to become governor of Guanabara and governed in accordance with free-market conservative principles. Having now assumed office, Lacerda prepares to implement significant reforms in order to destroy the Varguist consensus built by the previous PSD-PTB coalition. He is likely to have significant help in this from business interests and the OFN, whom he is known to favor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

bra_txtev7_1 = As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Adhemar de Barros enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. Adhemar won office as the leader and linchpin of the populist PSP, which seems to have no policies aside from what he dictates. If one were to ask the common Brazilian to describe de Barros, the first thing many of them would come up with is "corrupt". Yet Adhemar is also known for his competence; he leaves behind a trail of deals that benefit those who need it while at the same time lining his pockets and those of his supporters. This is where his nickname, Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz - Mister Steals-but-Delivers - comes from. Most observers are of the mind that Brazil is in for a "wild ride"; welfare bills are already being drafted and corruption is certain to grow by leaps and bounds during Adhemar's presidency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Elections are delayed and political parties have been merged together into a two party system, with a single party in government and another in opposition. The scheduled elections are to be cancelled and prominent civilian politicians such as former President Juscelino Kubitschek are expecting reprisals from the Government in what many believe to be one important step in Brazil's road to authoritarianism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

Reports from Brazil are unclear, but it seems that Lacerda alleged widespread fraud in the election on part of the PTB. Before these concerns could be addressed, he joined hands with allies to usurp control over the Presidency before Goulart could act. Goulart has fled the country, and Lacerda has now walked into the Palácio do Planalto as the President.

Lott takes the helm of a country faced with problematic levels of inflation and growing debt, among other problems that are doubtless on the way. While Lott has had many successes as a general, the people of Brazil hope that he will have the same luck as President.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_quadros1 = A great disaster befell the Brazilian common man when the conservatives of the UDN failed to win the 1960 elections. Quadros campaigned hard for a return to fiscal sanity, for an end of the corrupt Kubitschek era where the rich and corrupt feasted as the common laborer toiled, burdened by ever increasing debt and inflation. Many thought that Sr Quadros would languish in the vice-presidency, forced to stand aside as graft and malfeasance bled the nation from a thousand wounds. No more! Lott's own misdeeds have brought him low, and we now hold onto the presidency. Our enemies, the enemies of all Brazilians, are currently shocked at our ascension. They will rapidly recover, and their stupor will turn to anger. We must stabilize our position, so that the presidency can be turned once more into a lighthouse, a great beacon of order and progress for our great nation! Leeches and parasites shall tremble!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_andrade1 = The Hundred Days' Crisis has begun. President Lott resigned, Vice-President Quadros failed to seize control in the resulting vacuum, and the only remaining alternative, President of the Chamber of Deputies Goulart, who was the legal successor, was refused appointment to the Presidency by the machinations of Auro de Moura Andrade. The military, using the officer Sílvio Frota as a mouthpiece, has given the Senate exactly one-hundred days to choose a new President before it "does what it has to do". Disorder takes hold in the Parliament and the Republic more generally as four candidates - the PSD's Kubitschek, the PTB's Goulart, the PSP's Adhemar, and the UDN's Lacerda plan out their route to the Palácio do Planalto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_military1 = More than a decade ago already, we marched against the dictator Vargas who had done so much to undo this great nation. Today, we march again. Cowards within the senate accuse of seeking the end of Brazilian democracy. These slanderous accusations merely seek to distract from the catastrophes the politicians have brought down onto the republic. The average soldier is not an enemy of the constitution, but its most ardent defender. In recent times, elected officials have preferred chasing bribes and graft to fighting fascists and communists. It would be criminal negligence for us to let the situation fester any longer. The senate is to be closed. If democracy is to live in Brazil, we must act decisively to save the nation. Where the executive, legislative and judicial have all faltered, we shall succeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_kuby1 = In the aftermath of the chaos and misery that was the Hundred Days' Crisis, the former President Juscelino Kubitschek has once more been entrusted with the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. Though he had always had ambitions to run for the presidency once more in 1965, the chaos set off by the lunatic Quadros has made his return all the easier. As for the new President, he is justifiably confident in his abilities; as he enters the Palácio do Planalto, he knows that he will be able to save Brazil once more, as he did the first time around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_goulart1 = As João Goulart emerges from the Hundred Days' Crisis as the President of Brazil, he reflects on his journey to this stage. He remembers his duty to the people of Brazil, and how best to serve it. He reminds himself that he is the true heir of Getúlio Vargas and the most powerful promoter of his mentor's policies today. He supported Varguist policies from the start, and will keep supporting them throughout his career. But he also reminds himself that he is his own man, and has his own brain, replete with its own ideas. With all that going through his mind, he walks into the Palácio do Planalto for his first day on the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_adhemar1 = To the surprise and concern of countless Brazilians (and some particularly educated foreigners), Adhemar de Barros, the Bull of São Paulo, has emerged from the Hundred Days' Crisis as President of the Republic of Brazil. Of the available candidates, he was always the dark horse. This is reflected by the fact that every pundit, journalist, political gambler, expert, and other intellectual was united in saying that the odds of his winning out were near to zero. Adhemar, laughing in all their faces, has instead taken power and is now the tenant of the Palácio do Planalto. But as he walks into his new home to take over from his predecessor, he realizes just how weak his grasp on power is. He's going to have his work cut out for him if he wants to stay around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_bra_lacerda1 = The Hundred Days' Crisis has ended with a successful decision, and Carlos Lacerda emerges from the Congresso Nacional as President of the Republic of Brazil. As he is sworn in, a weight lifts off his back, since he knows that as President he is now safe from any danger - imagined or real - that he was in beforehand. Now it's time for the new President to put the lessons he learned as Governor of Guanabara to use and apply them to Brazil as a whole, with a view on cleansing the plague that is Getulism from the Republic and its people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.

#Heydrich

ev_burger = We saw this in our dreams, long ago: the end of the Reich. An apocalyptic storm of fire and blood, scourging the forests and mountains of our home. In its path stands a single man: Reinhard Heydrich, true heir of Hitler and former Reichsführer-SS of Germany. For the sake of the pure race, for the future of the Reich, for glorious salvation - he must win. Heil Heydrich.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_b-ss = The Burgundian SS are the most loyal and true servants of our cause. They alone possess the tripartite qualities of obedience to the Führer, freedom from temptation and absolute purity of blood. Their counterparts in Germany proper are loyal, but have been unduly influenced by feeble Hitlerism, while the Waffen-SS are little more than glorified mercenaries. Only the purest of the pure race are capable of securing victory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_d-ss = The Burgundians are noble allies, exemplars of all that is good and true in the Aryan race. The Waffen-SS are legions without number, disciplined and professional. But neither can win this war for us. This is a German war, fought on German soil. Only the blood of true-born Germans, raised in the heimat, can redeem the Fatherland. This will not be an easy path to walk, but walk it we must.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_w-ss = Where the Burgundians are unwavering fanatics, and the Deutsche-SS are trueborn sons of Germany, the Waffen are the legions that won us the world. Unscrupulous, merciless, obedient without question - not the perfect soldiers, but the best we can hope for, given the circumstances. With the vast legions of the Waffen-SS under the Führer's command, this senseless war will be put to a quick and decisive end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_d-ss1 = Science makes new discoveries all the time. That fact remains true for racial science. Once, not so long ago, it was said that only Prussians were truly German. Now, as before, our knowledge has expanded. There are more Germans than we previously thought in Europe, even if they have the misfortune of being born in lesser nations such as France or Bohemia. If there are any such individuals within our lands, they must naturally be granted the status of true Germans - and, as is their right, brought into the Deutsche-SS. Aryans of all nations, unite!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_d-ss2 = People of Germany... what more must I say? Germany is all that there is. It is where we were born, and it is where most of us would like to die. Germany is your home, your heimat. It is the cradle from which the greatest civilization the world has ever known grew. There is no higher calling, no greater glory, than to fight for Germany! Join us! For Germany, and the Thousand Year Reich!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_w-ss1 = An army without scruples is a dangerous thing, but the Führer cannot deny its effectiveness. The lack of racial discrimination in the Waffen-SS is concerning, but true Aryan qualities tend to manifest most readily after battle is joined. Opening up the ranks to anyone within the Reich who wishes to enlist would allow for a certain degree of... unwanted influences, but any impurities will be easily washed away by bloodshed. Doubtless such a show of magnanimity will also endear the Führer to the Reich's more uncertain citizens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_w-ss2 = It appears that the countless thousands who signed up with the SS don't understand the most basic of facts. All those promises, the 'honorary Aryan' status, the better conditions, the recognition as German - none of that is going to happen if we lose. They will all become mere subhumans once more. Heydrich is their only chance for salvation, the sole hope for their wretched, verminous lives to actually mean something. Live or die, you rats - time to choose!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_b-ss1 = In his greatness, Reichsführer Himmler has vowed to shore up our efforts with all the resources at his disposal. Guns, supplies, armor, aircraft, trucks; all that we need and more besides. More importantly, our Aryan brothers have begun to cross the border in a steady stream - one that shall soon become a ceaseless river. The hills of Alsace-Lorraine will echo once more with the march of jackboots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_b-ss2 = Fine. To hell with them! To hell with 'help'! We are the master race, conquerors of all Europe! Not a single nation dares to challenge us! We broke the Poles, we broke the Bolsheviks and we broke the damned Americans! We'll break these false Aryans too! All we need is fire in our hearts and cold steel in our hands! Fight, my brothers! Fight to the last bullet, to the last drop of blood, to the last miserable inch of this benighted land! FIGHT!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.

ev_hey0 = Aside from the militarists, many Speerites and Bormannites have survived the civil war. With their leaders gone, they have rallied to the banner of Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Fremde Heeres Ost. Though Gehlen is a sly and egotistical usurper, these civilians do lend a certain degree of legitimacy to his supposed authority. The civilians can hang for all the Führer cares - they are still traitors, after all. Gehlen, on the other hand, would be an invaluable asset owing to his decades of intelligence work and continent-spanning connections. He might be the sole individual in Europe capable of matching Himmler's operatives. Additionally, to our north, the famed 1st Panzergrenadier Division 'Berserker' continues to hold out in Pomerania. They have aggressively fought off both our forces and those of neighboring factions. Hitler's legendary sword and shield might serve Heydrich just as well.
ev_hey1 = Through the gates of victory arises Reinhard Heydrich, the one and only Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich. Treason, degeneracy and corruption tore the Vaterland asunder, but now the fires of war have purged it clean. Heydrich's leadership is a triumph for the Schutzstaffel, for National Socialism, and for one of its strongest defenders - Heinrich Himmler. Our Reich must be reforged in the image of Aryan greatness. Our society must be simple and pure. Our Germanic race must be ruthless and strong. Our future must be spartanist and everlasting. The barriers of decadence have been annihilated, and a new nation awaits us all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey2 = Nothing is the same anymore. The revelation of Himmler's plan has thrown all that we know into doubt. No longer can we be certain of our race's divine destiny, for our quests and trials over the past thirty years have come to this: the apocalyptic vision of a madman. But Reinhard Heydrich is not a man given to hesitation. The new Führer is sworn to the defense of Germany and the Aryan race above all else. The deranged Reichsführer will be dealt with in the same manner as all of our foes - with ruthlessness, cunning and strength beyond compare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey3 = At Himmler's back stand the collaborator legions of the SS: Charlemagne and Langemarck. Unlike Degrelle and the Walloons, their loyalty to Himmler is a little more concrete - but they still have their own interests, which the Reichsführer's goals are quite incompatible with. Coercion, bribery, and promises of independence should be sufficient to get us in the good graces of de la Mazière or Eriksson. Surely they would prefer an... 'equal' relationship to continued servitude?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey4 = Sad that it must come to this, but Heydrich is not called 'the man with the iron heart' for nothing. His friendship with Peiper is inconsequential if it could get in the way of saving the world from nuclear armageddon. Were the roles reversed, Peiper would do the exact same thing: swift and uncompromising strong-arm tactics. No matter their reputation, soldiers must learn to follow orders without question. He did it for Himmler once; now, let him do it for his Führer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey5 = How could the Führer have anything but respect for Peiper? He is a man who has proven his absolute loyalty to the Reich by word and deed, time and again. He is the physical manifestation of the SS' martial ethos. We shall approach him as a benevolent superior officer, not an aloof dictator. Peiper deserves fair treatment for his decades of service, no matter what disagreements we might find now. Harsh demands will not lure him down from his alpine fortress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey6 = It has been said that Remer loves war. He loves blitzkriegs, skirmishes, bombing campaigns, submarine warfare - everything. However, every man has limits to his passion. Himmler's nuclear war will be the last ever fought on Earth. In the space of mere hours, billions will perish for nothing. Remer might be bloodthirsty, but he is not insane. If we expose Himmler's plan immediately, we will decisively pull him into our camp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey7 = The split within the militarist camp has driven even its most hardcore followers apart. Our agents report that a manhunt is underway within Remer's territory for Ferdinand Schörner, once their de-facto leader. It appears that the field marshal's failure in the Bürgerkrieg has pulled the rug out from under him. Schörner may be a wanted man now, but the militarists would follow anyone with the strength to lead them. If we can find him, secure him and remove Remer from power, his supporters would rally again. Furthermore, his hatred of the SS defines him; he will ally with us in a heartbeat if it means bringing Himmler down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey8 = As the first conquest of the Third Reich, ownership of the Sudetenland will be integral to our legitimization efforts. The de-facto ruler of the area now is Konrad Henlein, leader of the old Sudetenland NSDAP. He has proclaimed a new movement, the 'Aryan People's Front', and renewed the defunct Lebensborn program to try and outbreed the remaining non-Aryan population in central Europe. Henlein and Heydrich have had a turbulent past; it was at one point necessary for our Führer to carry out a purge of the former's organization, an incident which he has been stewing over for twenty years now. This perverse little parasite is at least loyal to National Socialist ideals, and should prioritize them over servitude to Himmler. Burgundy's grip on him can easily be loosened, and the resources of the Sudetenland turned to our ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey9 = Henlein leans toward Himmler, but that can be remedied. Little does he know that in recent years, Himmler's definition of 'German' has tightened dramatically, and the Sudeten Germans are no longer considered pure under Burgundian standards. Henlein is a born follower and will defect the moment he knows his chosen leader is unworthy. Such mercurial men have their uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey10 = Henlein's initiative in restarting the Lebensborn program is most admirable. The propagation of Aryan seed is always a noble goal. There are, perhaps, some... objections to aspects of his management, but those can be set aside for now. Morals are silent in times of war, as the saying goes. More importantly, Henlein has a program; his leadership capabilities have been demonstrated. Bohemia-Moravia is in need of a new Reichsprotektor, and Henlein is just the man for the job. A loyal National Socialist, well-versed in dealing with Czechs: a man after Heydrich's own heart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey11 = Reinhard Gehlen refers to his little statelet simply as the 'Deutsches Reich', as if the Führer simply did not exist. Quite the grandiose assertion, considering that his 'Reich' is by all accounts a chaotic mess. Mass panic is the order of the day, since Gehlen's meager forces are obviously not sufficient to hold off the surrounding SS fiefs. What the intelligence chief controls is little more than a glorified refugee zone with the SS flags taken down. Still, Gehlen's claims hold no water, and are therefore not anything to be unduly concerned about. He poses no military threat, so we can deal with him at our leisure - though it should be soon, before his lack of a substantial army makes him a tempting target for Himmler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey12 = Unusually for an intelligence officer, Gehlen has a reputation as a pompous braggart. Somehow, this has never been a problem for him, as during the past decade he regularly ran rings around Heydrich's SS. Even the Führer admits he is impressed. Gehlen has a deep-seated hatred for the SS, and especially for Himmler - this will be the key to bringing him on board. Doubtless he already knows about the split in the SS, so the main focus must be on showing him the wisdom of an alliance against Himmler, for the sake of Germany.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey13 = Gehlen is an arrogant fool. He continues to play his egotistical power games, even as Himmler plots the destruction of our nation, our race and the entire world. The Führer has no interest in indulging that snake's vices just to groom his ego. The time has come to end Gehlen's puppet show once and for all. We have retained a coterie of loyal and experienced spies, veterans of many decades in the Gestapo and SD. No matter his reputation, Gehlen is not omniscient - he has a weakness, and it will be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey14 = Wewelsburg calls, and Heydrich answers. Klingenberg's fief is tearing itself apart as his SS falls to infighting, while anti-SS partisans harass him endlessly. If the Führer chooses to intervene on Klingenberg's side, it will be a time-consuming but rewarding venture. The fact that Klingenberg is of the Deutsche-SS will make him more receptive to us. He is clearly in over his head, and might appreciate deferring his responsibilities to a higher authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey15 = Why bother helping a feeble, snot-nosed upstart like Klingenberg? He has no high accolades, nor is his loyalty worth anything to the Führer. He thinks himself unassailable in Wewelsburg Castle, but battlements are no match for high-explosive artillery shells, even if they are draped in the black banners of the SS. We may not even need to kill Klingenberg, in fact. Wewelsburg is his entire reason for being there, a wretched attempt to appease a man who cares nothing for him. Bring it down, and Klingenberg's will shall crumble as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey16 = Otto Skorzeny has chosen a curious path for his homeland, seized against the Führer's will. He has chosen neutrality. Utter farce, of course - there are no neutrals in this conflict. We wage a war for the very existence of our world. He must choose: death, or the Fatherland. It is fortunate that Skorzeny is a man of reason - clearly, his whims have got the better of him. It falls to the Führer to bring the arch-commando back to his senses and onto the righteous path. First, though, we should probe his defenses - see what's been happening in fair Austria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey17 = Sepp Dietrich, famed Panzer commander, has apparently gone quite mad. He has seized Upper Bavaria and declared himself its duke! His rationale escapes us utterly, but that is irrelevant. What matters is that he is occupying a sizeable piece of the Reich, including prime agricultural land. Dietrich's realm is extremely unstable, and he does not enjoy the luxury of a massive panzer force as he did 20 years ago. However, every gun, every sack of grain and every soldier counts in this conflict; he must be brought to heel."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey18 = Let Dietrich have his piece of Bavaria. There are worse possible rulers for it, are there not? If he can keep the goods flowing and guarantee his support as a commander for our forces, his reign as 'Duke of Bavaria' is acceptable to us. What mad times we live in. Perhaps Josias will declare himself king next?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey19 = It is only due to Dietrich's skill as a commander that he is not already dead and dangling from a tree for betrayal of the Fatherland. To claim a noble title and impose anarchy on the birthplace of National Socialism - the hubris alone should be cause enough to put him down. But that would be too rash a solution. Now is the time for caution. We can still salvage the situation in Bavaria and offer Dietrich a chance at redemption in the process. First, though, we need to remove that rabble he calls an army...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey20 = It is good that the natural order of things has survived in Silesia - or a form of it, at least. Karl Hanke and his assortment of capitalist swine are not ideal leaders for National Socialism, but if they continue to run the factories and keep the slaves in their place, they will suffice. Now, we must assume control of Silesia ourselves, by any means necessary; it is one of the Reich's most important industrial zones. Securing those mines and factories for the Führer might give us the edge we need to match Burgundy's arms production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey21 = Though true National Socialism as envisaged by Heydrich would be free from capitalist interference, we must tolerate the industrial cartels for now. We can dismantle them later - right now, we need their managerial expertise to keep the arms factories running. IG Farben, Reichswerke, Daimler-Benz and Siemens all have a presence in Silesia. We should entreat them to support us against Himmler's efforts; we are natural allies, after all. Their money won't be worth anything if it's incinerated by nuclear fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey22 = If we must pick a poison, it will be Karl Hanke. His self-interested actions are concerning, but he is far more trustworthy than his industrialist allies. He maintains a strong ideological line, even if he has given far too much power to the cartels in Silesia. We will move in on Hanke and ingratiate ourselves to him, while at the same time reminding him of his past and duties as a member of the SS. It was through us that he was made, and he can be unmade just as readily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey23 = Grand Admiral Dönitz has made his 'triumphant return' from Crimea now that the dust has settled. Not that he is here to offer loyalty - in fact, we are not certain of what he intends to do. Despite being an avowed Bormannite, it seems he is not here to contest Heydrich's rule. Our sources claim that he is conducting some kind of rescue operation near the border with Denmark. Indeed, many refugees have been fleeing north, causing no shortage of trouble for us. Stemming the flow might make things easier on us. On the other hand, they are still citizens of the Reich, and deserving of protection. Aiding them might be the key to forging an alliance with Dönitz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey24 = Heydrich and the SS are the only protectors the Reich needs. Dönitz is a relic of times gone by, a man out of time. Heroes cannot save the Aryan race in these dark days - it takes one monster to slay another. That is the fate Heydrich accepted long ago. The refugee columns must be halted and forced to remain in our territory. We need the manpower and resources. Let them hate us for it; we ask not for their love, only their obedience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey25 = Regardless of our political disagreements, Dönitz is a hero of the Reich. He may not be of the SS, but it was his leadership and tactical genius that allowed the Kriegsmarine to achieve final victory over the fleets of perfidious Albion. Let us assist the Grand Admiral with his rescue operation. Saving Aryan lives is more important than political games, especially if it earns us the Kriegsmarine's loyalty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey26 = Johannes Steinhoff is no friend of the SS, but he is one of the Reich's greatest flying aces and a lauded commander of the Luftwaffe. With most of the surviving Luftwaffe and a sizeable Heer contingent, he has established a base in Regensburg in a desperate attempt to survive. Steinhoff's people are hemmed in by the SS and crying out for a savior; that savior could be Heydrich. Would it not be right and just for the Führer to protect them from the predations of traitors and madmen alike? Steinhoff would be obliged to display gratitude in such a case...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey27 = The best way to win over Steinhoff is by providing what he needs. He is short on fuel, ammunition, spare parts and manpower - all things that we can give him in exchange for an alliance. As a pragmatic man, he is unlikely to turn us down, especially given his empathy for the people under his care. This tactful approach will cost us time and resources, but will pay off in the long run. The more the Führer shows his generous side, the more likely people are to believe it truly exists. That would be most useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_hey28 = We have no interest in Steinhoff's pitiable excuses. He knows the stakes, that without us he and everyone under his wing is doomed. If he refuses our help, he has no future. We need to make that fact abundantly clear to him. We are not without mercy, however. We shall supply the Luftwaffe with what they need, but only once their loyalty is certain. Just to be sure, our men will have to move into Regensburg to keep watch on them. Steinhoff will not object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.

#RFK

ev_usa_rfk =  Election Day has come and passed, and Robert F. Kennedy is now the 36th President of the United States. The new heir to one of America's greatest families had blazed a cross-country campaign trail, promising to deliver equality for all Americans. To the worker, he promised better wages and better workplaces; to the old and infirm, he promised pensions for their hard work. To the sickly, he promised healthcare, robust and cheap; to the homeless, he promised homes of their own. To the colored man, he promised the rights they had been withheld for decades, that they can live freely and securely in the land of their birth. Though they had been subject to both doubt and ridicule -- from both his opponents and his own party -- the results speak for themselves. President Kennedy has his work cut out for him in the months ahead. Cracks are starting to show in the NPP's united front, and Republican-Democrats from county to state have already pledged to stonewall his legislation. But America's downtrodden now look to him for deliverance, as they once did to his brother. If Jack never quit even in his final seconds, then neither will Bobby.
ev_usa_rfk1 = The United States of America is perhaps the greatest nation in modern history. Its footprint spans from the far shores of Australia to the icy mountains of Iceland. With the only challengers being the barbarous Japanese and the failing Germans, there is no doubt freedom will span the rest of the world in no time. Our fair nation faces a paradox, however. While we project Uncle Sam on every continent, Uncle Sam himself is sickly and weak. His fingers ache with arthritis and his stomach grumbles with the hunger of a nation subsiding on little but what he can beg for. As we throw our army and money and navy off to foreign lands to fight foreign foes, we let our own people starve and grovel for scraps. No matter how much it costs to the very bones and blood of our nation, we must close this great gaping fault in our great country, not just for America, but for the world.
ev_usa_rfk = The eternal chaos that is American politics has only been tempered by the fortunate election of the National-Progressive Party to power. It still stands built on a shaky foundation of corruption, partisanship, power-mongering and war-profiteering. While Kennedy has been working to finally put the chaos to rest, he has decided that to do this he must work with the enemy. Temporarily, of course. Not permanent. RFK announced his new policy of cooperating with the republican party, especially over their socially liberal policies as well as their progressive views on the welfare state. With the Republican party essentially being forced to take any oppurtunity they can, they've grabbed Kennedy's generous hand with eagerness. Now, with the NPP and the Republicans working hand-in-hand, we can finally put the death-throes of old American politics to rest.
ev_usa_rfk2 = The eternal chaos that is American politics has only been tempered by the fortunate election of the National-Progressive Party to power. It still stands built on a shaky foundation of corruption, partisanship, power-mongering and war-profiteering.

With the Republican party essentially being forced to take any oppurtunity they can, they've grabbed Kennedy's generous hand with eagerness. Now, with the NPP and the Republicans working hand-in-hand, we can finally put the death-throes of old American politics to rest.
ev_usa_rfk3 = Political pundits lampoon the NPP voter as a schizophreniac: Mercurial, erratic, quick to shift opinion in between gulps of breath. A disingenuous portrayal of the party at large, of course... but to brush their words off without a second thought is to ignore the problems that had plagued the NPP since its inception. Contradictions over platform and policy are inherent in any big tent party with presidential ambitions; befitting its unprecedented scale, the National Populist Party runs the whole gamut of America's broad political spectrum. Conversely, establishing party-wide consensus and a united front against the Republican-Democrat opposition will be difficult due to the wide variety of ideologies it tolerates. Only hatred of both the Rising Sun and the old establishment binds the party together. In any other scenario, it would not have existed. President Kennedy has decided to prioritize forming the consensus his party and his agenda desperately needs. Getting Wallace and Chavez to sit at the same table will be an exercise in herding cats -- but by hook or by crook, the NPP will stand together, lose together, and win together for his term and beyond."
ev_usa_rfk4 = They may be few, but men and women of good principle still remain within the whitegold edifices of Washington D.C. These advocates of change come from many backgrounds and classes and caucus for different parties, but all believe that the United States is in dire need of political, social, and economic reform. For the Progressive movement, no other option guarantees America's survival for both the near and far future. Currently, America's progressives rally under two factions: President Kennedy's own Party Center, and Senator Lyndon Johnson's Republicans. Both extremes of the NPP will raise objections over cooperating with the R-Ds, and Senator Johnson is infamous for both his temperament and his... peculiarities. Nevertheless, bipartisanship accords legitimacy to legislation in the eyes of the American people. A show of unity with our natural allies across the aisle can smoothen the passage of progressive policies for less backlash and compromise.
ev_usa_rfk5 =  None have contributed more to the black American's suffering than the Dixiecrats of old and new. This geriatric band of white good ol' boys hold an iron grip on the reins of power throughout the South, eager to defend Jim Crow under the flimsy pretense of "state's rights". If one wonders why supposedly free men continue to live like slaves in Alabama, Louisiana, and a dozen other states, look no further. Unfortunately, such cretins also comprise a sizable portion of the NPP. Since having split from the Democrats, Wallace and his cronies rail against the slightest push for civil rights from our corner of Congress. His word carries far beyond our party, across party lines and to millions of like-minded Americans. Despite his misgivings, President Kennedy has decided to parlay with the Party Right in a series of publicized meetings. No doubt they will demand concessions in exchange for support -- but we do not have the luxury of choice. Either the Civil Rights Act passes, albeit heavily reduced... or it does not pass at all.
ev_usa_rfk6 =  While committed, the Party Center is only one of three factions bound together by a shaky coalition. Our moderate inclinations toward reform does not endear us to both Left and Right, to say nothing of the Republican-Democrats who hold a dim view on any reform at all. This position is terrible for passing bills favorable to any President's agenda; after all, our supposed allies can and will abandon us should they deem it convenient. For President Kennedy, the solution is obvious: compromise. The Party Center must actively take steps to reach every corner of every aisle and come to an understanding with as many Senators and Congressmen as possible. Genuine dialogue with party leaders will help convince doubters of our well-meaning intentions, making them more willing to vote alongside us in Congress. Acquiring the majority necessary to enact reform is a prerequisite to success for the next four years, and no petty accusations of "selling out" from his base will convince the President otherwise.
ev_usa_rfk7 =  The assassination of John F. Kennedy was not just another shock to American politics, it was also a great personal tragedy to his brother Robert. The younger Kennedy has struggled with his grief for a long time and has often even blamed himself for his elder brother's demise. Now that he is in power, he has decided that the best thing he can do is to honor John's legacy by embodying everything that he stood for." dignity, equality, and emboldening the spirit of America.
ev_usa_rfk8 =  Our nation has always been a melting pot for a multitude of peoples of all colors and creeds, and yet the idea of America as a nation for whites alone persists. It was the peoples' desire to put an end to this tired old sentiment that swept Robert Kennfedy into power. If we are to move forward as one country, we must remove the legal obstacles to the full integration of all races and a guarantee that all might be afforded the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We are likely to face stiff opposition from southern conservatives and even from within the Far-Right ranks of our own party, but we must push on in the name of a fairer and more equal America.
ev_usa_rfk9 =  Many within the Party Center consider Republicans to be our natural allies in the fight for civil rights, separated from us only by party lines drawn up in the chaos that followed the Second World War. Indeed, they had voiced their support for the last such Act in the past, and their frustrations when Nixon vetoed it. Should we inevitably propose another, they may well prove to be better allies than our own Party Right. Negotiating with Senator Johnson is crucial for guaranteeing the Act's passage. Success means a stable coalition that will advance and safeguard the civil rights of all Americans for the rest of President Kennedy's term -- for that alone, compromise is worth the backlash the administration may receive from within the NPP.
ev_usa_rfk10 =  The NPP cannot pass a Civil Rights Act at its current state, and the White House knows it. In fact, our opponents are hedging their bets precisely on our awareness as we speak, hoping that the President's indecision feeds into a perception of weakness; for now, such is confined to the fringes of popular opinion. Rather than let it spread any further, our policy planners have crafted a daring proposal: to release a draft of the Civil Rights Act so extensive as to draw the outrage and ire of everyone but the most progressive Americans. The Administration can scale it back to a more palatable state afterwards, and in doing so cultivate an image of compromise and level-headedness for the President himself. It is a highly risky proposition, least of all for the President's ratings, but one that also presents high rewards: should the gambit work, then Congress will have unwittingly agreed to the version of the Act we want.
ev_usa_rfk11 = Despite their stark differences, President Kennedy and Senator Johnson have had frequent and productive meetings in the Oval Office as of late, where they discuss the finer points of the work-in-progress Act. These meetings often last from morning to midnight, involving copious amounts of pens, paper, cigarettes and hard liquor. Whatever words were exchanged between the two (and reports abound from anonymous staffers of particularly coarse language being liberally employed), they both leave having taken two more steps towards the Act's final version. Such displays of inter-party... cooperation... has since motivated other NPP and Republican Congressmen, especially those who both belong in committees, to work together for the cause which they both wish to advance. Hand in hand, none can stop us from together delivering the American people the rights which they truly deserve.
ev_usa_rfk12 = With every line typewritten into a clean sheet of paper, every debate settled amicably, every item brought to consensus, the NPP inches ever closer towards its ultimate goal. Slowly, the final version of the Civil Rights Act takes shape -- months of sore throats and fatigue had given birth to this one end-product. The American people eagerly await the day it is put to a vote, now a definite date rather than an estimation that shifts with the wind. Needless to say, so are we. All that remains is to sort out minor minutiae -- utterly trivial in comparison to the hurdles we have long traversed. With one last burst of speed, one last push, we can finally type the last dot and begin the countdown towards role call.
ev_usa_rfk13 = The repudiation of Wallace was accompanied by a sudden influx of support from America's civil rights community. This cause-and-effect relationship is easy to explain; after all, they had suffered more than most from the Jim Crow Laws our now-diminished Party Right have enthusiastically advocated. Siding with our erstwhile coalition meant siding with those who had made them and their forebears' lives slavery long after it was abolished. An opportunity to work closer with these advocates for freedom has presented itself in front of us. Having done away with the party's garbage, President Kennedy can now formally reach out to the colored men and women at the forefront of the civil rights movement. Coopting their strength will be a boon like none other for the NPP, and nothing breaks the ice better than bonding over the woes of a shared enemy.
ev_usa_rfk14 = Who else can explain suffering better than those who have suffered? Those fortunate enough to have lived carefreely may learn their experiences, but theirs will be a clinical sort of knowledge: detached, unfeeling, passive. Crimson ichor spilled on soil by a cruel, centuries-old injustice become little more than words of black ink printed on plain paper -- words and pictures simply to learn from, but not to act upon. Progress may be made with the help of the fortunate and careless; defending progress in spite of convenience, on the other hand, requires those with spirit tempered only by experience. Everywhere one looks in this country will they find no shortage of such men and women. They belong to all walks of life, all sorts of occupation, bearing scars from lashes both tangible and invisible. Now that we have made inroads into their communities through their leaders, the time has come to accept them into our fold.
ev_usa_rfk15 = An act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide injunctive relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes. The title is droll legalese, but do not be fooled by its outward appearance. The Civil Rights Act heralds the greatest flowering of American political freedoms since the Bill of Rights, searing into the country's book of law the rights withheld to select citizens in many of its states. Millions of Americans will see their fortunes improve at last, breathe true freedom at last, witness jubilo at last, should this Act pass the baptisms of Congress. The fate of millions now hangs in the balance, as do the sacrifices we have made to reach this point. Pray that our lawmakers will listen to their conscience and make the right choice.
ev_usa_rfk16 = The Civil Rights Act has finally become law of the land, and Congressman and layman alike celebrate their victory. Despite bellicose rhetoric tinged with the Southern twang aimed at the righteousness of our cause, millions of dollars spent on defaming and harassing our leading figures and humble rank-and-file, and colorful broadcasts meant to turn the American public against us -- despite aggressive assaults from cantankerous, hateful racists -- twenty million Americans can now truly exercise the rights which we take for granted. But the struggle for true equality has yet to be won. Obstacles remain for the colored man to hurdle, ones which had centuries to entrench themselves into the American system. Invisible or otherwise, they pervade and corrupt the very institutions which proclaim to deliver liberty and justice for all. For now, we shall revel in this seminal moment in America's history. Let us take care, however, not to grow complacent on our laurels, lest we see our current success undone.
ev_usa_rfk17 = The situation we have found ourselves in is dire and bleak. Our foothold in Congress remains tenuous and prone to faltering, and our words fall on the deaf ears of more Americans than comfortable. As pressure mounts both within and without the NPP for President Kennedy to pass the Civil Rights Act -- whether to succeed or to fail -- negotiating with the Republican-Democrats becomes an increasingly attractive option. But compromise entails sacrificing principle for convenience. For a Party long defined by its commitment to its own agenda, the former is something it cannot afford. Let the Republican-Democrats stew in their own hypocrisy. The NPP can march forward to the future simply with the support of its ranks and the integrity of its Congressmen.
ev_usa_rfk18 = On the President's desk lays the Civil Rights Act, unblemished by compromise, fastidiously maintained by men of power and principle in equal measure. It stays true to the words it enshrines, offering wide-ranging guarantees to all Americans irrespective of race, faith, sex, and creed -- desegregation in both public and private establishments, workforce quotas, abolishment of poll taxes and literacy tests -- duly enforced by the federal government. Despite protestations against "forcing the Act through without sufficient discussion" echoing in both aisles of Congress, President Kennedy could not have asked for a better bill. Getting the votes to ensure its passage is still an obstacle to hurdle, however, and whether or not he can ever ink his signature on the first page remains to be seen.
ev_usa_rfk19 = America is by far the wealthiest, most prosperous and free nation on the planet. While Germany continues to flounder desperately trying to preserve its empire of evil and Japan perpetually stamps the boot down upon its oppressed peoples, we continue to stand tall as a beacon of liberty and prosperity. And yet there are still pockets of people within our nation without the means to live. They struggle to put food on the table. They struggle to find legal counsel when they have been wronged. They live in the most squalid and dire conditions imaginable. In allowing this to happen to our own people, how can we call ourselves any better than the fascists? Robert Kennedy intends to rectify this situation with immediate effect, with a range of measures aimed at granting aid and welfare to our most vulnerable.
ev_usa_rfk20 = The president has returned from his tour across our nation. While it made for a good PR opportunity, he is disquieted by the sheer level of poverty he encountered in some of the most destitute parts of America. That we can claim to be a superpower while our own citizens endure such grueling hardships is appalling. As long as there is plenty, poverty is evil, and the president will make absolutely sure that his office will dedicate itself to the eradication of poverty in our great country.
ev_usa_rfk21 = To Americans, a house is not simply a refuge from the elements, a shelter providing warmth, or a storehold for their prized possessions. A house is their castle, within which they feel most secure than anywhere else on Earth. A house is their domain, its walls marking the bounds whereupon their word is absolute law. A house is their symbol, and with it they declare to the world that they are freemen, beholden to none but their government. Strip an American of his house, and he becomes little more than a slave. What does it say of today's America, then, that most of its citizens do not have the money to buy a house of their own? The Party Center has long been aware of this problem, and have drafted a bill designed to encourage the construction of affordable housing projects in America's booming cities. Soon every American will own a castle -- but that is in the far, far future. We can instead content ourselves for having guaranteed that future as soon as President Kennedy signs it into law.
ev_usa_rfk22 = New, untried reforms have the inherent risk of failing and becoming sinkholes for taxpayer dollars. Policy planners may make predictions based on theory and advise accordingly, but a law's performance can be measured only after it is implemented, not before. Without caution to restrain the hastiness of politicians who pine for reforms, America will have seen a hundred good laws passed in a hundred days... and a hundred failures that burden its treasury for little gain. For his part, the President is keen to remind NPP Congressmen and their constituents that lasting reform will come in due time. At the same time he has authorized the Cabinet to implement a backlog of policies at a small scale, as test programs of sorts. With them we can acquire much-needed data on how well our reforms achieve their objectives without having expended too much money on abject failures.
ev_usa_rfk23 = "...A day will come when all who are gathered here today will leave this Earth for the pearly gates of Paradise. Our bodies may turn to ash and our names may scatter to the winds, forgotten, but the actions that define our lives will leave an indelible mark on the ground we tread and the air we breathe. By such a time our sons and daughters will inherit the world which we had shaped into our own image. Can we, in good conscience, leave them with ruins they can neither comprehend nor restore? "This administration has endeavored to secure the future of your children through making changes to our country's economic, social, and political structures. With affordable housing, your children will possess the greatest security civilization provides. With affordable healthcare, your children will possess a mighty bulwark against malaise and injury. And with affordable education, your children will possess the knowhow not only to survive, but to prosper, to stand on their own two feet long after you're gone..."
ev_usa_rfk24 = With Congress convinced and the American people appeased, there is no better time to hold the culmination of our work, money and time to a vote. The Economic Opportunity Bill is one of several proposals comprising what history will consider the most comprehensive piece of economic reform introduced to Capitol Hill since the New Deal era. From large school grants to nationwide vocational training programs, federal food charities to cheap houses, it is a panoply of measures both guaranteed and experimental with the intent of tackling, and hopefully reducing, the spectre of American poverty. The War on Poverty may not even end in our generation, or our children's generation, or their children's. But we will sound its death knell with this bill's enshrinement, announce to the world that its days are numbered. In a hundred years or a thousand, the American people will celebrate a mission accomplished -- take pride for having laid the foundations of their triumph.
ev_usa_rfk25 = For the longest time, American companies have abused the liberties we have granted them to wean every last bit of soul out of their workers. They pay them in paltry pennies, barely enough to get by in even the most ramshackle sections of the cities. They offer no compensation for injuries at work, expecting them to perform as if they were healthy and pale... and worsening the wounds should they fail to meet expectations. It is a fact that America's greatest names inflict the greatest miseries onto America's meekest in pursuit of greater profit, yet few dared to speak against it in the past. The Kennedy Administration seeks to change this miserable state of affairs by guaranteeing every American worker and employee an hourly rate for their labor, safeguarding them against the worst excesses of modern capitalism. More will have to change for their miseries to be fully assuaged, but none can ask for a finer small step than a minimum wage for all working Americans.
ev_usa_rfk26 = In principle, the fruits of a man's labor blossom and ripen to their sweetest as he ends his working days. Smart saving and wise investment will guarantee that he can spend the twilight of his life enjoying it to the fullest, bliss accompanying him until he breathes his last in warm comfort and warm company. While this holds true for America's moneyed, the same cannot be said for America's many moneyless. One must plant seeds before being able to nurture a fruiting tree, after all -- and what are our underclasses but sharecroppers who sow seeds bearing only their landlord's names? To the President, the solution is simple: public pensions which guarantee a portion of a worker's check to a deposit which he will receive upon retirement. In time this deposit will grow to a healthy extent, enough to sustain their owner's needs until their inevitable departure.
ev_usa_rfk27 = In a healthy society, its members are free to pursue their own paths towards self-fulfillment without their dues becoming too great a burden to bear. Anyone can become whoever they wish to be, provided they work in earnest for it. In contrast, a sickly society leaves little room for free expression and social mobility: everyone has a place and appropriate standing, whether they like it or not. In America, that place is dictated by a man's dollars -- earn too little, and they cannot dedicate themselves to anything but making enough to get by. It stifles the faculties and puts undue stress onto the working man, but more importantly it foments dissent which simmers into a violent, caldera-breaking boil. This can be prevented with a robust network of benefits and pensions which they can rely on to make ends meet. Although President Kennedy had promised such, whether or not he can back rhetoric with action in the face of bipartisan backlash remains to be seen.
ev_usa_rfk28 = The right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to pursuit of happiness. These are what our Founding Fathers called America's "inalienable rights", those which the Lord God had guaranteed to every man and woman within its bounds as a matter of course. It is, and should be, America's government's duty to secure these rights for its own citizens, act as instruments of His will. Unfortunately, we have fallen short of the responsibilities our forefathers had once enshrined. Today the American worker lives without the financial and personal securities which allow him to live freely and pursue what makes them happy. This is a problem that President Kennedy has pledged to rectify, though figuring out the particularities of the solution will take some time.
ev_usa_rfk29 = Capitol Hill, by necessity, knows more about the true state of the Union than its own people; however, it is not omniscient. The knowledge with which it bases its policies relies on a complicated hierarchy of departments, agencies and offices. All of them are staffed with normal employees and managers -- and humans can err and possess their own agendas, as Nixon attests. President Kennedy's ambitious road trip provides us with an opportunity to learn more of the American people's plight than tabulation sheets processed in D.C., thus giving our planners more information for the Administration's reforms. Additionally, it allows us to offer them their government's tangible presence, to reach out and assuage their worries of being left unheard yet again.
ev_usa_rfk30 = The American worker's struggle is one of small victories eked out from titanic sacrifice. Noxious smoke, searing heat and blistered feet for fourteen hours a day, often more. Bruises and dead bodies littering factory yards, while hired thugs protect priceless machines from valueless men. "Fair compensation and fair pay", say the picket signs, as brave men and women stare at barrel holes of tense firing lines. The government's answer, at long last... but only after, not before, the inevitable massacre. The worker's memory is long and their history ugly, as blood red as the flags they wave. Reaching out to this country's many scorned requires acknowledgement from those who had ignored it -- and we, their government, are to them the worst kind of ignorant. President Kennedy can only appeal to their last bit of hope, and promise them that the blood they had shed shall not be in vain.
ev_usa_rfk31 = What good does owning the richest farmland in the world do if you cannot feed your people with it? Despite having more food than the world has people, Americans still shuffle along sidewalks clutching at their stomach. Americans in our cities and towns still loiter around diners, malls and restaurants, begging for scraps and leftovers and hoping for good Samaritans to come their way. This is the stark-naked truth: America's bounty is locked behind a rich man's windowpane, and its penniless can only stare at the sustenance denied to them from the harsh outside. Progress for America means progress for all of its citizens, its most vulnerable most of all. We must lift them up to a better lot in life by any means necessary, but before anything else we must approach them with our good intentions. If nothing else, they must know that no American will ever go hungry if President Kennedy gets his way.
ev_usa_rfk32 = Since Kennedy's great American tour, we have made many strides in increasing the appeal of our reforms in the United States. Every day that passes is another day where we make our case to the American people, and where the NPP's ranks -- in particular, the Party Center's ranks -- grow in number. But the good that we have done here must not be constrained to our borders. As the Free World's greatest champion, it is our responsibility to cultivate support of our newfound freedoms overseas. With that in mind, the Kennedy Administration has established a think tank for individuals who share its will to spread freedom of, by and for the people, but not its means. They will work with our neighbors and with member-states of the OFN, drafting policies that both align with their country's priorities and further their own people's inalienable rights. In due time America will spearhead a new breath of freedom for a world filled with tyrants, and Roses International is its speartip for this noble endeavor.
ev_usa_rfk33 = They go by many names: colored, Afro-American, black, Negro. Poor ghettos and ramshackle slums define their communities, simultaneously close and far from the services offered freely to the white American. Hatred and isolation define their experience; establishments close their doors shut at their presence, lawmen eye their every footstep. Whereas the Nazis have their Jews and the Japanese their Koreans, these descendants of African slaves are America's own brand of outcasts, proving to all that the words which hearken to our nation's founding ideals are worth less than mud. True equality cannot be achieved until our outcasts are lifted up to the standard and dignity which all Americans rightly deserve. For this purpose, President Kennedy swears to continue advancing their cause even after their victory in Congress over the Civil Rights Act.
ev_usa_rfk34 = What can America gain from a people so bitterly divided that they cannot work together to propel it to higher heights? In their foolish and foolhardy pursuit to deny afro-americans their liberty and happiness, the vestiges of Slave Power nevertheless sought to create -- and had created -- a deep crevasse that separates one America from another, living in mutual animus. In this they are aided by a school system which, thanks to segregation, impresses upon children from the outset that those of a different color than they do do not belong to the community in which they belong. To President Kennedy, the next milestone for a newer, better, and more just American society is the thorough redrawing of America's school districts. It is a task that will take generations, but integrated schools will ensure that the bonds between black American and white American, once severed by a growing chasm, will eventually heal. So shall America be truly united once again -- or perhaps, so shall America be truly united for the first time in its history.
ev_usa_rfk35 = Throughout the rigorous pursuit of truth and justice, we have come to learn of harsh truths and grave injustices both. We have learned of a webwork of clients and patrons stretched from coast to coast, colluding with one another to keep the carcass of a hateful ideology alive. We have learned of suffering dealt directly and indirectly, by Americans to Americans born with the "misfortune" of unlike skin. We have learned of iron fists that bear whip and chain and clad themselves in Old Glory's hues, lording over miserable men just as their ancestors had but a century ago. Not that we haven't known then, of course -- but enlightenment does brings clarity to sight. Words and actions of reprehensible men, then puzzle pieces each showing some but not all, suddenly locking into perfect shape. Now we know their conviction, their utter belief in a hatred which seems to lurk behind our every corner. Now we know how far their poison has tainted the idyllic veneer of American society, blemishing its hallowed values with so much hypocrisy. Much has already been done to undo the damage... but perhaps we've still a long way to go from fully repairing our society from it.
ev_usa_rfk36 = "With step by arduous step had we taken the path to a brighter place, where every American is privileged to enjoy the essential values and virtues of their patrimony: freedom, liberty, equality, prosperity." "The journey has not been easy: Our feet are blistered and sore, from the hundredfold miles of travel and the heat and roughness of inky black asphalt. Scars and wounds mar our flesh, left by monsters and bandits. The voices of doubt yet whisper from the recesses of our minds, tempting us with illusions of earthly comfort wherever our eyes land. So long has it been since we last laid in rest that we have forgotten the touch of soft cotton and embroidered linens. Dirtied, famished, parched -- the body can only do so much against its instinct, and it beggars us to stop even for a short while." "But we have not stopped. We cannot stop, not now. Not when the promised land shimmers in the distant horizon. If we're to rest our feet forever, then let them tread into the land of light, where forever is beautiful..."
ev_usa_rfk37 = The Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Central Intelligence Agency. The National Security Agency. In theory, these agencies comprise the arm of America's law dedicated to shield the country and its citizens from threats both foreign and domestic. In theory, this triad, and a plethora of others, are the eyes-in-the-dark which watch over America while she sleeps: a protective gaze that gives much but asks for little, and whose honest, dutiful, and law-abiding work is its own reward. Never before has practice diverged from theory more distantly than the alphabet soup agencies that form the so-called "cult of intelligence". In their zeal to protect America from threats both real and imagined, they have trampled upon the rights of the very citizens which form America's body politic. For the good of the country, something must be done to rein them in.
ev_usa_rfk38 = Every politico in the Beltway, from lowly staffers to beloved Presidents, learn to watch their backs from J. Edgar Hoover. The FBI's infamous director, Hoover has both the means and the will to acquire every single skeleton in an unlucky man's closet. Those unfortunate enough to have gained his ire or refused his wants will see their careers brought to an ignominious end by scandalous bombshells leaked to the press by "concerned citizens". Such is the chilling terror of who many consider the kingmaker of Washington D.C. President Kennedy cannot be cowed so easily, however. Untouchable he may be, but the Director has just as many skeletons as any old statesman. With proper planning and the right people, we may be able to catch him with his own trap. Getting arguably America's greatest spymaster on our side as a stable weapon will be a great boon for the longevity of the President's agenda, despite the risks involved...
ev_usa_rfk39 = "To Serve And Protect", so goes the refrain. Ideally, the dual matters of "who to serve" and "who to protect" should not be addressed -- the equality of service and protection is a sine qua non for a government agency. To our shame, America's officers have taken advantage of the motto's good faith to display... selectivity, suppose to say, in its implementation. The prejudices of our police forces presents not merely a moral quandary any good man should overcome, but a scattering of thorns deeply embedded within the body politic, sending shooting pains throughout the country as it attempts to grow freely. An examination is long overdue -- and like any good doctor, we must adhere to our oaths and do our best to root these thorns out.
ev_usa_rfk40 = Seasons change and crises come and pass, both bearing stormy winds that do away with facades to unveil the true hearts of men. Such has undoubtedly been the case in America, in recent years, as the NPP continues the onwards march to delivering freedom and equality -- true freedom and equality -- in the country. With all that has happened, is it really any surprise that winds of stormy change had unveiled the Dixiecrats' hearts and found a rotting, fetid organ? Long have we disavowed them from what should be and is becoming a party of progress, yet their presence lingers in their home states, ready to impede the federal government from enforcing its own laws every step of the way. A party of vipers, through and through -- perhaps they can only be handled as vipers should?
ev_usa_rfk41 = We have the will of the people. They do not.
ev_usa_rfk42 = America, as we have come to realize, is a land of towering contrasts as much as it is a land of towering skylines. We preach the word of freedom, but also keep freedom away from swathes of our people. We preach exercising the God-given right to vote, but also keep that right away from those we deem "unworthy" of voting. So do we bluster and boast of the liberties we supposedly cherish... but in the same breath order judges and sheriffs to snuff the opportunity to cherish liberty for a great many Americans. We have come to government and seen the injustice that had seeped into its sinews, and have rightly decided that this state of affairs cannot stand. What is unjust must be set just at last; towards this, we must turn our stern gaze to the lawmen who had overseen the effection of unjust laws.
ev_usa_rfk43 = Hearings, unheard. Early missives somehow reported missing late past their schedule. Orders' word and phrase changing as they climb down every rung in the ladder of law enforcement, letter-swapped into wholly new messages by the time they reach the common patrolman. Work continues as we bring the rights of man to the rights-deprived South, yet work continues as ploddingly slow as it was since the days of Reconstruction. We must admit to ourselves, at this juncture, that work cannot continue unless we address the root from which these issues are birthed. If the Dixiecrats aim to win this little war with a thousand bleeding pinpricks? Then we shall have to grab them by the stem and root them out all the way to the Godforsaken tip!
ev_usa_rfk44 = "Clemency" goes the watchword from certain members of the NPP these days. Savvy and careful at the same time -- flawlessly shifting between assuring President Kennedy that they most assuredly condone his actions and urging for a more... moderate... approach in handling the rot, more often than not within the same breath. They clad themselves in propriety and restraint, of law and order and fairness, contrasting themselves from the swift and righteous justice which they see only as "crude" and "un-American". So do they parrot old President Lincoln's words: for all Americans to come together and bind the nation's wounds. Any doctor worth their degree will tell you that mending wounds without cleaning them will only invite disease and decay, bringing slow ruin to the body within. Ever has the racism of our Southern "knights" been the metastasizing tumors of dear Columbia's bosom; as all good doctors should, therefore, it is our duty to excise them before stitching her sutures that they may begin mending. For this task our "moderates" have shown to be obstacles and impediments hindering good doctors' pace. President Kennedy believes an ultimatum will suffice in either bringing these mutineers to heel... or allowing them to exit their posts with grace.
ev_usa_rfk45 = It has been an oft-observed irony that present laws of free speech often protect those whose very nature assumes that free speech is a sham. The unwavering blindness of Lady Justice, lawmen argue, dictate that all speech, no matter how hateful or spiteful towards the rights of others, must be placed under equal protection. Thus one may find hatemongers standing atop their soapboxes and radio towers, questioning why their victims should enjoy the very rights they are using to browbeat them into submission! This is a farce that has gone on for far too long. Either these malcontents stick to the spirit of free speech, rather than abuse its words to their fullest extent, or they shall find themselves bereft of any speech at all.
ev_usa_rfk46 = Ask any bitter cynic about American justice a year ago and they will have unabashedly spoken of its hypocrisies, and the miseries they have caused to those it swore to protect. The perverse and corrupting touch of racism has caressed it since the nation's founding, hence failing to unleash its otherwise heavy blows towards slavemasters old and new. Nothing will change it, they will have lamented, so misfortunate the American black has been, is, and will be." "Fast forward a year later. Our campaign against the Dixiecrats and their beloved Jim Crow has seen to much change in the shape of American lawmaking. Civil rights now flow freely from the marble-domed courthouses where puppet-judges once enforced edicts of barely-concealed hate. Policemen now patrol the streets without regard for the criminal's skin color. Gavels now punctuate fair verdicts for all Americans, as if their wielder now wears Lady Justice's blindfolds in every trial." "Ask a bitter cynic a year ago that things will change, and one will only be responded with the spiteful laughs of hopeless men. So are we behooved to reach out to them and give them hope until we prove them wrong..."
ev_usa_rfk47 = Long have we battled the specter of racism in the halls of Congress, the courts of law, and the streets of asphalt. From all sides we have been struck and slowed: To our front, the dying husks of Jim Crow; to our back, its sympathizers akin to the Copperheads of old, wearing the skin of progressivism no matter its flimsy, transparent make. From side to side, wastrels apathetic to the misery corrupting America's foundations from the inside out, threatening to upend the comfort with which they live. But we never wavered. Neither did the throngs of huddled masses behind us, pouring blood, sweat and tears into the dangersome fray for the slimmest chance to breathe the free air of our beloved country. Every right forged in brotherly love in the bleak days of revolution -- alloyed with brotherly blood in the horrible days of civil war -- we upheld with every barricade upended, every dog-headed racist ousted, every black brother and sister unchained. Now nothing is left of America's original sin, save for the sputtered, choking gasps of the "peculiar institution's" misbegotten son in its backwaters. In yet another trial of fire, America has seen itself battered, bruised, and bleeding... but unbowed still. Though fresh wounds mar its skin, now is it truly meet to mend and heal it from the many ordeals it has faced.
ev_usa_rfk48 = Justice prospers where rightly-guided laws are duly enforced and adhered to by all. Conversely, improperly applied laws which liberate are as dangerous as properly applied laws which oppress, for the former demonstrates the government's incapacity to dispense justice wherever needed. Justice requires cooperation between both intent and practice; deprive one of the other, and tyrants blossom where good men ought. Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that every injustice heard to have occurred in this supposed land of freedom is a threat to the very freedoms it enshrined as law, and the justice which they should cultivate.
ev_usa_rfk49 = In penitentiaries, offices, academies and cruisers from East to West, the words "To Serve And Protect" shine bright when struck by the midday Sun. It is the motto which America's police forces have chosen for themselves, both a summary of their duties and a pledge to the people at large. For those America's police had sworn to serve and protect, however, their motto rings hollow. In many infamous incidents, they had neither served nor protected the American people -- instead, they served those with the money to acquire their services, and protected the assets which they deeply prize. Securing the backing of the American worker entails ensuring their safety from their own law enforcement, that they may not tread upon their rights like they had in the past. Their brutality is one that President Kennedy endeavors to restrain through both talk and action.
ev_usa_rfk50 = With Congress convinced and the American people appeased, there is no better time to hold the culmination of our work, money and time to a vote. The National Labor Relations Act is one of several proposals comprising what history will consider the most comprehensive piece of economic reform introduced to Capitol Hill. Designed to protect the American worker from severe exploitation of their work, its articles formalize a large expansion of their rights: an eight-day work week, the freedom to join unions, and more. The War on Poverty may not even end in our generation, or our children's generation, or their children's. But we will sound its death knell with this act's enshrinement, announce to the world that its days are numbered. In a hundred years or a thousand, the American people will celebrate a mission accomplished -- take pride for having laid the foundations of their triumph.
ev_usa_rfk51 = With Congress convinced and the American people appeased, there is no better time to hold the culmination of our work, money and time to a vote. The Social Security Act is one of several proposals comprising what history will consider the most comprehensive piece of economic reform introduced to Capitol Hill since the New Deal era. It establishes systems aimed to provide monetary assistance to those who cannot provide for themselves -- the unemployed, the retired, and the disabled -- all managed by a dedicated government agency. The War on Poverty may not even end in our generation, or our children's generation, or their children's. But we will sound its death knell with this act's enshrinement, announce to the world that its days are numbered. In a hundred years or a thousand, the American people will celebrate a mission accomplished -- take pride for having laid the foundations of their triumph.
ev_usa_rfk52 = "I know many who lament and despair over the state of our country in these uncertain times. They have seen the injustices that ail it, yet cannot fathom how they can treat it. They see within themselves only one man, one woman, facing an unstoppable behemoth, and so raise their arms in frustration and say that nothing can stop its onslaught. I disagree." "History is replete with examples of one changing the lives of many. One priest born to a carpenter in Judea became a figure worshipped by a billion souls today. One sailor ventured westward with some hundreds of his faith, in doing so founding the first of our forefathers' many colonies. One nomad in the steppes of Asia conquered ancient civilizations to found an empire that stretched from Nanjing to Moscow." "These men alone prove that the actions of a few can forever change the course of history -- and that you yourself can bring change to this country. The shape of today's world began with them; let the future's, then, begin with you..."
ev_usa_rfk53 = Democrat, Republican, National Progressive -- whatever the label, one cannot deny that they belong to an American. They all obey the same laws, read the same histories, and share the same culture (with variations from state to state, of course). They speak the same language (somewhat), uphold the same values (with... divergent interpretations), live within the same country (although a state may be its own country, according to some). They may have differences as distinct as night and day, but as sure as the sun rises and sets in twenty-four hours, they are all Americans. (And Alabamans, and Texans, and Californians, and...) We must not let these divisions grow to disrupt the greater identity which we all share as fellow Americans. That path leads to disunion and suffering. Whenever possible, let us reconcile our petty differences in Congress in the spirit of a good American: with open arms and a wide smile, with malice towards none and charity for all.
ev_usa_rfk54 = Since our entry in the Second World War, America has been embroiled in a terrible struggle against the powers of fascism. The Japanese menace looms beyond our allies in the Pacific, and the Nazi Reich continues to crush the once-free peoples of Europe beneath a polished jackboot. As tyranny engulfs the world in oppressive shadow, we remain standing -- bloody, beaten, yet standing against all odds -- to bear freedom's torch and light a path for those who resist within and without its bounds." "Despite what certain warmongers may tell you, however, this struggle cannot be won by force of arms, nor by a ruinous race for weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, this war is unique among humanity's long history of conflicts in that it cannot be won by once-tried and true methods of warfare. Rather, our greatest weapon against the fascist threat is the values and principles that had long defined Western civilization: freedom, liberty, equality, democracy. Duly applied, these shall become the stony foundations of a healthy and prosperous society, built to last the trials of time far better than autocrats and their foundations of quicksand and mud..."
ev_usa_rfk55 = Years of planning with cold, hard data, to best tailor it to the nation's needs like a beautiful gown on a womanly figure. Tense negotiations in the dead of night, dim lamplight and lit cigars illuminating sheets of paper crisscrossed by red ink. Speech after tiring speech in a hundred cities, thousands of hours drained away, all to harden wills, turn hearts and sow doubt. Few but for the NPP's far-sighted envisioned that the day our efforts bear fruit would come -- yet here it is, in its sempiternal glory. Our past acts have flirted with, but not quite achieved, the concept of universal healthcare: total coverage for all citizens, free of charge. Years prior, even some within the party would balk at the costs involved for such a program, let alone the wisdom of granting free and unrestricted healthcare paid for by the federal government. But the administration persisted, slowly winning hearts and votes, until the National Healthcare Act finally stands before Congress, ready to be judged for its worth. If passed, the mechanisms for the most robust universal healthcare system in the world shall soon be put into place. This is a significant victory for both American democracy and the people it serves. Whatever happens, congratulations for having reached this point.
ev_usa_rfk56 = These few years saw us take risky gambles and hard sacrifices, as if struck with a fever pitch of madness -- but at last, the reforms have paid off handsomely. Black Americans now see their rights granted, expanded, and truly protected for the first time. Working Americans now come home every week with more money and in better health than the last. Voting Americans now approach the ballot boxes confident that their voice will be heard in the halls of Congress. What no one can fathom that fateful day in '64 has been realized in under a decade, enriching the American's life and freedom like never before. Through our tireless efforts, a golden age is just within reach for our nation's greatest and most blessed generation to claim as theirs.
ev_usa_rfk57 = The President may revel in America's long-deserved victory against its own evils, but he does not forget the lives lost and ruined to achieve it. Among the honored dead count his own brother, John Kennedy. Deprived of life by a madman's barrel, he had nevertheless kept America from bleeding further after the bastard Nixon tore bloody gashes at its neck. Most importantly he restored faith in America's democratic institutions following Nixon, overseeing what would have been a return to normalcy; indeed, many believe he would have succeeded and more had tragedy not struck as it had. Jack had always been a vocal believer in doing what was right. No doubt about it: he would have been proud of Bobby were he alive to see what his little brother had accomplished. The President has scheduled a short trip to his brother's resting place. What he will do there, only he seems to know.


bobby.justice.51.t:0 "The Noise of Thunder"
bobby.justice.51.desc:0 "Our ban on the KKK has been a pure, unmitigated disaster. Not only has it failed to stop their now-illegal activities, it has turned out to be completely unenforceable as Southern police, most likely Klan members themselves, refuse to break up Klan meetings and arrest known leaders. Klan affiliates have been screaming themselves hoarse on almost every radio station that broadcasts south of the Mason-Dixon, free speech rallies have been held in several major Southern cities, and as the cherry on top of this sundae, we're getting whipped every which way in Washington by the Democrats and the rightists in our own party. Even the Republicans aren't too keen on it. To make matters worse, if that's possible, the Klan is planning a huge rally atop Stone Mountain in Georgia, where they're going to burn a gigantic wooden cross that will be visible all over Atlanta. We have no choice but to send in the army to watch over the gathering and keep the peace, but even that will leave law and order teetering on a knife's edge. If this goes wrong the South could go up like a pile of dry wood struck by lightning. We can only hope this doesn't turn ugly. When their backs are against the wall, men who burn the symbol of their worship are liable to burn anything."

usa_rfk_snm = It's still unclear who shot first. Before the cross had even been lit, tensions were high atop Stone Mountain. Turnout was several times what we expected and our troops were massively outnumbered by Klan members, both masked and boldly unmasked, many armed. A single sudden shot was all it took to light the powderkeg, and Stone Mountain erupted into sudden and horrific violence as our troops opened fire on the crowd and the Klansmen followed suit. By the time the shooting stopped and the smoke had cleared, twenty-five bodies lay beneath the smouldering cross on the mountaintop- four soldiers and twenty-one civilians, all suspected Klansmen. Their wives and daughters weep on television screens all over America. The South is ready to explode, and the rest of the country isn't much better. People are in an uproar over what they see as the government murdering people who were protesting against their breaking the First Amendment. Radio demagogues ask whom the "Yankee hit squads" will go after next. Needless to say, this is bad for us. Goldwater, Thurmond and their allies are screaming red-faced in Congress and there's not a newspaper or a news program in the nation on our side right now. Even many of our staunchest political allies are distancing themselves from us. Right now the country is in shock, and all we can hope is that it fades quickly. But, sitting alone in his unlit office and thinking of his murdered brother, the President has a bad feeling that the Stone Mountain Massacre, as they're calling it, will stain his legacy like nicotine.



#Tomsk
ev_tom_intro = The fall of the Soviet Union brought untold hardships on the people of Russia. Yet in this darkest of hours, the embers of hope could not be crushed by German militarism. In Central Siberia, so recently developed by Bukharin's industrial ambitions, a new democratic Russian state was born: The Central Siberian Republic led by the Poet-President Boris Pasternak, the new nation set out to build itself up as the basis of a new Russian Democracy, a heir to the one killed in 1918 by Lenin and his Bolsheviks. This dream rapidly turned to a nightmare. Landlocked and unable to trade with the rest of the world, the Central Siberian economy struggled to adjust. Separatist sentiment in Barnaul, breadbasket of the Republic, brought instability and food riots throughout the nation. Sensing weakness, Genrikh Yagoda's Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic launched an invasion of the Central Siberian Republic, no doubt lured by the industrial wealth left over from Bukharin's Central Siberian Plan. The war was the spark that set off a chain reaction of disasters. Regional military leaders in Novosibirsk seceded, citing the central government's inability to win the war and end the bloodshed. In the east, anarchist rebels seceded from the failing Republic. An attempt to recapture the area by General Krylov led to further defeats after the betrayal of colonel Andreev and the loss of Krasnoyarsk. Broken, Krylov retreated to Kemerovo where in a bout of insanity the fallen general declared himself the reincarnation of long dead king Rurik. Through all this the people in and around Tomsk maintained their loyalty to the central government. President Pasternak suspended elections after the fall of Krasnoyarsk and declared a provisional government to stabilize the failing Republic. Through all this, Pasternak and his advisors worked long hours to stabilize the food situation and ensure some semblance of normal life could return to the capital. Even being diagnosed with cancer has not stopped President Pasternak from his herculean struggle to prevent the collapse of the Republic. Despite Pasternak's popularity, the people of Tomsk can see the Provisional Government is only able to manage the Republic's decline instead of turning things around. All hope is not lost, however, as the Poet President has begun work on new foundations for the Republic. Believing that distance from the people and failure to mobilize the masses into supporting the nation has doomed the old Central Siberian Republic, Pasternak has begun drafting a new constitution, one that would allow the Republic to tap into the vast pool of intellectuals, artists and scientists in Tomsk. The Siberian Athens, blessed with schools, universities and salons, shall rely upon its four greatest political associations in order to achieve its revival: the conservative Decembrists, led by Russian medievalist Dmitry Likhachyov; the centralizing industrialists of the Bastillard salon and their leader, avant-garde poet Daniil Kharms; composer Dmitry Shostakovich's utopian socialists of the Humanist Society; and the liberal technocrats of Andrey Sakharov's Modernist salon. Citizens, the Republic is at a crossroad! Only through experimentation, courage and dedication can the Central Siberian Republic phoenix rise from its ashes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n.
ev_tom = There would be no more productive days for the poet president. Boris Pasternak had laid in bed for most of two weeks now, coughing fitfully. His children attended to him. Old friends, old rivals came to visit him. His wife, Zinaida, had come to talk, and talk they had. She had forgiven him some, although not all. Better that than nothing. His love, Olga Ivinskaya had also come by. How he wished he could have seen her more, have had something better for her than a few short visits, ushered in through a side door. Another regret for a life of regret. He had not done right to his wife nor his mistress. Hopefully he had done right to his country. Harder and harder to stay awake. Fitful sleep. Late afternoon coating the room in amber light. Standing by the bed, one of his sons, saying something. Hard to see him well, hear him well. "I can't hear you well. And there's a mist in front of my eyes." He tried to smile. "But it will go away, won't it? Don't forget to open the windows tomorrow."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n.

#Modernists
ev_tom_m_e = Andrey Sakharov stood in the middle of the crowd, eager to hear from their new president. After all the campaigning and debates in the Duma, the Modernists had won a decisive victory in the elections. The Modernist's campaign had promised large reforms to satisfy the needs of Tomsk and to prepare for the coming challenges. Scientists, bureaucrats, professors, and common men and women who just wanted a better future had all united behind the Modernist Slogan. Now, it was time to make it a reality. Andrey couldn't hide how truly happy he was, this was the proudest moment of his career. "Thank you, all of you, for your support of a smarter, more modern Tomsk. Together we can get to the heart of every problem and fix it from the ground up. I promise you a lot will change in the coming months, and it will be for the better. Our small democracy will become a stronger one, one where all will be able to vote quickly and easily. Our great education will become even greater, where all will be promised basic schooling and the best universities in Russia. Our government will be rebuilt to be one of merit and efficiency." "I also promise to the workers of Tomsk that they will see great changes in their jobs, ones that will satisfy both the workers and their bosses. More factories will also be built, to modernize our economy and provide civilians with what they want and the military with what they need. On that final note, we will not just bring these reforms to Tomsk. I promise to you and your families that democracy will be brought to all of Siberia, and the future holds a strong and united modern Russia. Thank you."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n.
ev_tom_m = It is time for us to begin the first phase of our reforms. These reforms will deal with democracy, education, and meritocracy. While we still need to stick to our roots, we can't just leave problems unsolved. Our ideals have been important to our leadership from the beginning of our independence. They must be perfected and molded into a new shape for the future. Tomsk and all of Russia has fallen behind other nations for far too long now. Dealing with these issues first will prepare us for the challenges to come, and pave the way towards a modern Siberia. Their is a bright future ahead. It is time we meet it head-on. There won't be a clear path ahead though. Choices and sacrifices will need to be made to pave the way towards progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
ev_tom_m1 = We must build a better democracy. Due to the difficult conditions of Siberia, many people have trouble getting out and voting, due to them having to worry about actually surviving the harsh climate and not having access to voting locations. This makes our mandate of democracy thin. Are we even democratic if no one votes? This is an issue that cannot stand. Everyone should have the chance to vote without worry. If we want to claim to be the greatest democracy in all of Russia we need the people to get out and vote. We have two choices ahead of us. Either go with the tried and true approach of more ballot boxes and more voting booths or something new, such as machine registration. Either way, we'll have to do it right; every vote counts in barren Siberia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n.
ev_tom_m1a = Let's stick with the tried and true methods of increasing turnout. We don't need any advanced technology to make voting easier. These methods have worked for years and there is no reason to abandon them now. Just improving what we have will be much more efficient. When has it ever failed? If we try hard enough nothing can go wrong. The same can't be said about machines. We will build more infrastructure and make more voting tools available to the people. Sometimes the simpler answer is the correct one. More voting booths in the cities and places to register will work best. Also what could go wrong with building a little infrastructure?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_tom_m1b = It is time we take a new approach to voting. New machines have been developed that can make voting easier and faster. We can use these machines to make the voting process more efficient. However, this is a new process, and very experimental. We have no idea if it will even work as intended. Anything could go wrong, so it is very risky. Nevertheless, the reward could be even greater than the risk. A modern democracy like ours could be very prestigious. It will also be cheaper and easier than getting a ballot box to every small town and village and making sure all votes are counted manually. Why do we call ourselves Modernists if we don't even modernize the country?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n.
ev_tom_m2 = The second tenet of our government is education reform. Currently, our education system is one of the best in the current state of Russia. But we can do better. After all, a nation full of scientists and intellectuals needs a place to teach, learn, and study if we want to keep them in Russia. Our education must be the pride of Siberia. We can have the best schools west of the Urals. Who would ever want to study anywhere else in Russia? Definitely not under the close eye of any dictator. Our first effort will be to build schools in rural areas. While we may have great schools in the city of Tomsk itself, there are many underdeveloped towns and villages that go without basic or higher education. Then, we can focus on opening more colleges and universities in Tomsk itself. No one will go without education!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_tom_m2a = We need to focus on the present, not the future. Let's focus our studies on the sciences related to the survival of Russia as a whole, and not get bogged down with other, less prevalent, issues. We need to aim at the big picture, not waste our time funding small sciences and experiments that probably won't even work. We must not get distracted from our main task, creating a modern and efficient Russia. No lab experiment can fix social problems or make sure all the people have food to eat. The people of Russia want sensible solutions, so that is what we will give them. The researchers and scientists need to be directed to work on the people's problems, not ones they make up to entertain themselves. They can worry about their physics papers after our enemies aren't trying to destroy us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n.
ev_tom_m2b = Let's focus on the future, and on more theoretical education. We have the best framework for research left in Russia, so why not use it? We can expand our studies on physics, chemistry, and biology to make new discoveries and help the lives of the less fortunate in Tomsk. Our President, Andrey Sakharov, is a physicist himself. He has made many useful discoveries serving Russia and Tomsk. We should try to expand these educational services to be able to teach even more students interested in the sciences. Who knows what discoveries could be made in the future! One can only dream. It must be our mission to make Tomsk an even greater scientific paradise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n.
ev_tom_m3 = Our third tenet is an efficient bureaucracy, one with fewer errors and more work. Bureaucracy has always been trouble for many nations in the past. Have too much or too little of it and you will get nothing done. While ours might not be as broken, it could still use some adjustments. We need to create a smoother administration to make our government even more effective. There can always be a better Tomsk. To start, we're going to have to shuffle around a few departments. It is also necessary that we train more bureaucrats in the art of coordinating a country. Of course, there are also more modern solutions. We could use the new technology of computers instead of people to do some of the tasks needed. A more capable and efficient administration is just around the corner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m3a = Machines are too unreliable and complicated to deal with the necessary tasks of Tomsk's bureaucracy. Continuing with a human workforce will help us achieve bureaucratic efficiency. Machines and computers could make our administration even more costly and inefficient, you can never trust a computer to do a human's work. More people will need to be hired to take on the new jobs of our growing government, we need a skilled administration to make sure the job gets done right. Corruption and incompetence cannot fester in our government. Tomsk must heighten its standards so more capable bureaucrats can handle all of the behind the scenes work that needs to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m3b = We should use technology to make governing Tomsk easier and more effective. Humans can make simple mistakes that computers will never make. Computers can also work much faster than any person, solving calculation after calculation with peak efficiency. Although computers might not be able to do every job, they can still take up some of the time costing tasks of processing endless bureaucratic data. A machine could do this faster than any person, and it could allow them to be moved to more important jobs a computer cannot handle. A group of scientists, engineers, and researchers in Tomsk are willing to build these machines that can process data inputs and categorize them efficiently. We can help by funding their project. A new future of technology and innovation awaits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m4 = Now that we have dealt with the major tenets of our platform and completed many of our reforms, we need to move on to some of the more miscellaneous issues of Tomsk. While we have improved society tremendously, there are still problems waiting on the horizon. The looming union issue is starting to become even more problematic. There is a lot of opposition among our workers as they are demanding better conditions and more rights. We need to handle this quickly and carefully if we do not want it to get out of control. We also need to focus on reforming our industry to meet the challenges of defending our democracy. Threats of war are growing ever closer and our enemies are growing stronger by the day. Production needs to be increased and more buildings constructed before it's too late.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m5 = A major part of a nation's economy is its workers. Generally, the workers of Central Siberia are not treated very well. Long hours, low pay, and dangerous conditions all impact the performance of the factories and mines of Tomsk. The workers cannot live like this forever, we need to improve their jobs at least somewhat. We will take some preliminary and token reforms to keep the laborers satisfied for now. However, our government will have to decide if we want to go for even more reforms or remain with the status quo and only use ones that are necessary. While it may be better to give the workers better jobs, maybe if we continue down the status quo we could do it our way. The industrialists within our party already have a few ideas about reorganizing the management to create peak economic efficiency. Perhaps their ideas could be put to use, but are they really fair to the workers?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m5a = The workers of Tomsk deserve better conditions and rights. Their bosses shouldn't be allowed to exploit them for all their worth just to take it for themselves. Tomsk should be a free society for everyone, from the lowly worker to the noble corporate owner. New improvements such as safety reforms and minimum wages must be introduced. We need to end absurd worker injuries and make sure managers are more responsible for their employees. A minimum wage will also make sure the workers are paid fairly and can actually afford to live. We can also generally improve worker's rights by making sure workers can join their respective unions, have better conditions in the workplace, and are provided with necessary safety equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m5b = It is a danger to mess with the fragile balance of our industry. Our intervention could end up only tossing oil on brewing worker discontent, while hurting productivity. We can only introduce token reforms while not doing any real change to not anger either employers or employees. Tomsk is a democracy under siege, and any concessions we give now could be a danger to us later. A loss in productivity would be equally disastrous for our army in the field. These rights and improvements that they are clamoring for will be given after the war, not before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m6 = It is time we improve the industry of Tomsk. For too long Tomsk has been without businesses, having more universities than factories. It is time we build and improve factories so we can serve and protect Tomsk. Experts have already begun inventing and creating better industrial tools for the workers. We need a higher work rate so we can outproduce our neighbors. Our enemies cannot have the upper hand in the coming struggle. In addition, we must choose between our civilian and military industries. We can't put all our effort into both. It's a tough sacrifice, but a necessary one. We must choose between a stronger defense or a better standard of living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m6a = Our situation demands we focus on our defenses before a high standard of living. Living standards can drop; survival matters more than comfort. They won't be calling for higher standards when an invader knocks down their doors. New armament factories are to be opened to allow more weapons of defense to be made. We can't have a shortage of guns on the battlefields. We will also prepare to sign more defense contracts with the private industry to ensure the smooth flow of armaments from the factories to the supply lines. We must not let ourselves be caught off guard!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m6b = Why do we need even more weapons of war? Our primary concern should be for the people, not the military-industrial complex. We need to turn away from the need for armaments, as Tomsk needs to be a land of peace, sensibility, and diplomacy. The main industry of the republic will be put to use in ensuring that the people and workers will no longer suffer again. We can't ignore the needs of our own citizens who cry out for better living conditions onto deaf ears. We must listen to their cries and help them, not let them suffer. The poor can no longer be ignored like they were in past regimes, lest they decide our republic is not good enough for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n.
ev_tom_m7 = With our goals of reforming education, administration, and democracy accomplished, it is time we take up a new motto, "To Justice Through Science". We have done all we can in our capacity to reform. While not everything may have been fixed perfectly, we have still transformed Tomsk into a much more powerful and effective state. However, for true justice to be achieved there needs to be an understanding that originates itself in science. That must be our goal.

ev_tom_d_e = It had been a melancholy crowd that gathered in front of the Cathedral of the Epiphany to listen to Boris Pasternak's speech about the end of the provisional republic. Now the mood of the public in this early morning was much different. Amidst jubilant Decembrists, ordinary citizens had gathered in the square, curious to see the new president. After the end of vote counting the previous night, Dmitry Likhachov of the Decembrist Society had won the presidency of the Republic. Likhachov's speech was brief but concise. After thanking his voters for their tireless support, he expressed his sincere hope that the other salons would accept him as president and work with him. He went on to explain which reforms he would pursue, chief among them being reforming Tomsk's prison system, overhauling the rural infrastructure that tied the scattered cities and villages of the Republic together, and robust protections for the environment and Russia's traditions. In contrast with this very rational and calculated string of objectives, Likhachov added a flourish of emotion to cap off his speech. "As a scholar, I've long spent my days reading about Russian history, about the good people of wide steppes and deep forests, about their ability to incorporate new ideas and strange customs into their own life. I must thank you all once more for giving this old student of Russian history a chance to make his own mark on the destiny of this great society. Russian freedoms endure within all of us. Our future is ours for the taking."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n.
ev_tom_h_e = In the working class districts of Tomsk as in some of the most refined cafes and tea houses, supporters of the Humanist Society followed the radio with bated breath. When Dmitry Shostakovich's victory in the presidential election was announced, many wept. Through the years of the Anarchy and during the slow and painful collapse of the Central Siberian Republic, others had lost faith in the decency, the inherent goodness of each Russian citizen. Not the humanists. Throughout the celebrations, workers gathered around public speakers, listening to the humanist salon's manifesto. The party's activists loudly rejected Marxist socialism as well as disorganized anarchy. A new, modern choir of democratic voices would rise, directed by the government as maestro. To the citizens, the nation would bestow help, would try to limit the excesses of industrial work, and would ensure education and health in good times as well as in bad times. In return, the nation would expect effort from its children. A new culture of political assemblies, a willingness to dare and to improve the world around them, and a steely determination to join the army of citizen soldiers that would march out unto the fields of central Siberia. In his apartments, Dmitry Shostakovich celebrated with friends and family. The following years would not be easy. But from Pasternak's frail shoulders unto Shostakovich's own failing body, the burden of state would be carried. The Republic would endure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n.
ev_tom_b_e = The day after the elections was a regular work day. Tram lines and railway stations were crowded as the nation's people returned to work. The results of the elections were on every person's lips. Of the main parties, the Bastillard were the least well known at the dissolution of the provisional government. The salon had its adherents, of course. Among the bankers and industrialists, whispers that the Central Siberian Republic had not been hard enough were rife. Ideas of an iron republic, where the workers knew their place, and an endless stream of weapons and consumer goods made the nation strong and prosperous. The salon also had its adherents among the republic's soldiers, who felt that the army needed rebuilding in the wake of the devastating war with Yagoda and mutinies. Daniil Kharms had been the Salon's secret weapon. Well loved for his humanitarian work and as a writer of books for children, the eccentric poet had run a fantastic campaign among poor workers and among the elites of the capital. Over and over he hammered his points: Tomsk needs industry; it needs rigor; it must be fanatically opposed to extremism. The separatist province would be brought back into the nation. Domestic and foreign threats had to be dealt with aggressively, if Russian democracy was to live. To this simple end, the Bastillard society had prepared robust economic plans to stimulate civilian and military industry and infrastructure. With the day's end, all began to return home. Only, this time, train stations and city centers the nation over were covered in art. Songs written by workers, posters painted in the style so common to the murals found in Tomsk. Street theatre, acted on by members of the Bastillard Society. Most common were crude statues, hammered from industrial scraps, a veritable immobile army. All oriented toward the south, where the renegade provinces cowered from a resurgent Tomsk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n.
